First up, I tried modifications to the 5 layer design we discussed in class. None of them got me past 97.8% accuracy on the validation set, so I tried increasing the intelligence of the network by increasing the number of layers to 6. The most basic 6 layer Conv got me nearly 98.9% accuracy, so I knew I just had to fix the other hyperparameters. I played around with different types of regularization: l1 and l2 were pretty useless. Dropout, on the other hand, combined with data augmentation: rotation_range=8, width_shift_range=0.08, shear_range=0.3,height_shift_range=0.08, zoom_range=0.08, yielded some very good results. However, I only got my accuracy above 99.5 once. 
Final accuracy=99.55
