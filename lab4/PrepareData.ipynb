      "should have arrived at 646, but train was an hour late\n",
      "BudaPesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets\n",
      "I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible\n",
      "The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East\n",
      "the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule\n",
      "We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh\n",
      "Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale\n",
      "I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty\n",
      "I asked the waiter, and he said it was called paprika hendl, and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians\n",
      "I found my smattering of German very useful here\n",
      "indeed, I dont know how I should be able to get on without it\n",
      "Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania\n",
      "it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country\n",
      "I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains\n",
      "one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe\n",
      "I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps\n",
      "but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly wellknown place\n",
      "I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina\n",
      "In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians\n",
      "Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North\n",
      "I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns\n",
      "This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it\n",
      "I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool\n",

      "There was a dog howling all night under my window, which may have had something to do with it\n",

      ", get recipe for this also\n",
      "I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to the station at 730 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move\n",
      "It seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains\n",
      "What ought they to be in China\n",
      "All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind\n",
      "Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals\n",
      "sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods\n",
      "It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear\n",
      "At every station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts of attire\n",
      "Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers\n",
      "but others were very picturesque\n",
      "The women looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy about the waist\n",
      "They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them\n",
      "The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cowboy hats, great baggy dirtywhite trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails\n",
      "They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches\n",
      "They are very picturesque, but do not look prepossessing\n",
      "On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands\n",
      "They are, however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural selfassertion\n",
      "It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place\n",
      "Being practically on the frontier\n",
      "for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina\n",
      "it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it\n",
      "Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions\n",
      "At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease\n",
      "Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly oldfashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country\n",
      "I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress\n",
      "white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty\n",
      "When I came close she bowed and said, The Herr Englishman\n",
      "Yes, I said, Jonathan Harker\n",
      "She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves, who had followed her to the door\n",

      "I trust      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land\n",
      "Your friend,  DRACULA\n",
      "I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count, directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me\n",
      "but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and pretended that he could not understand my German\n",
      "This could not be true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly\n",
      "at least, he answered my questions exactly as if he did\n",
      "He and his wife, the old lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of way\n",
      "He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that was all he knew\n",
      "When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further\n",
      "It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting\n",
      "Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way  Must you go\n",
      "young Herr, must you go\n",
      "She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all\n",
      "I was just able to follow her by asking many questions\n",
      "When I told her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business, she asked again  Do you know what day it is\n",
      "I answered that it was the fourth of May\n",
      "She shook her head as she said again  Oh, yes\n",
      "I know that\n",
      "I know that, but do you know what day it is\n",
      "On my saying that I did not understand, she went on  It is the eve of St\n",
      "Georges Day\n",
      "Do you not know that tonight, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway\n",
      "Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to\n",
      "She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect\n",
      "Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go\n",
      "at least to wait a day or two before starting\n",
      "It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable\n",
      "However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it\n",
      "I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go\n",
      "She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me\n",
      "I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind\n",
      "She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, For your mothers sake, and went out of the room\n",
      "I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late\n",
      "and the crucifix is still round my neck\n",
      "Whether it is the old ladys fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual\n",
      "If this book should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my goodbye\n",
      "Here comes the coach\n",
      "The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed\n",
      "I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake, naturally I write till sleep comes\n",
      "There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly\n",
      "I dined on what they called robber steak\n",
      "bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cats meat\n",
      "The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable\n",
      "I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else\n",
      "When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady\n",
      "They were evidently talking of me, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door\n",
      "which they call by a name meaning wordbearer\n",
      "came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly\n",
      "I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd\n",
      "so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out\n",
      "I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were Ordog\n",
      "Satan, pokol\n",
      "hell, stregoica\n",
      "witch, vrolok and vlkoslak\n",
      "both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire\n",
      ", I must ask the Count about these superstitions  When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me\n",
      "With some difficulty I got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant\n",
      "he would not answer at first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye\n",
      "This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man\n",
      "but every one seemed so kindhearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched\n",
      "I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard\n",
      "Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseat\n",
      "gotza they call them\n",
      "cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey\n",
      "I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather languages, which my fellowpassengers were speaking, I might not have been able to throw them off so easily\n",
      "Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road\n",
      "There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom\n",
      "apple, plum, pear, cherry\n",
      "and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals\n",
      "In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the Mittel Land ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame\n",
      "The road was rugged, but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste\n",
      "I could not understand then what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund\n",
      "I was told that this road is in summertime excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows\n",
      "In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order\n",
      "Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point\n",
      "Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves\n",
      "Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly\n",
      "Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water\n",
      "One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snowcovered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us\n",
      "Isten szek\n",
      "Gods seat\n",
      "and he crossed himself reverently\n",
      "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us\n",
      "This was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink\n",
      "Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent\n",
      "By the roadside were many crosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves\n",
      "Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world\n",
      "There were many things new to me for instance, hayricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves\n",
      "Now and again we passed a leiterwagon\n",
      "the ordinary peasants cart\n",
      "with its long, snakelike vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the road\n",
      "On this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves, with axe at end\n",
      "As the evening fell it began to get very cold, and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow\n",
      "Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys\n",
      "Sometimes the hills were so steep that, despite our drivers haste, the horses could only go slowly\n",
      "I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home, but the driver would not hear of it\n",
      "No, no, he said\n",
      "you must not walk here\n",
      "the dogs are too fierce\n",
      "and then he added, with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry\n",
      "for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest\n",
      "and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep\n",
      "The only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his lamps\n",
      "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as though urging him to further speed\n",
      "He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions\n",
      "Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the hills\n",
      "The excitement of the passengers grew greater\n",
      "the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea\n",
      "I had to hold on\n",
      "The road grew more level, and we appeared to fly along\n",
      "Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us\n",
      "we were entering on the Borgo Pass\n",
      "One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial\n",
      "these were certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz\n",
      "the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye\n",
      "Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness\n",
      "It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation\n",
      "This state of excitement kept on for some little time\n",
      "and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side\n",
      "There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder\n",
      "It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one\n",
      "I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count\n",
      "Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness\n",
      "but all was dark\n",
      "The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud\n",
      "We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle\n",
      "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment\n",
      "I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone\n",
      "I thought it was An hour less than the time\n",
      "Then turning to me, he said in German worse than my own\n",
      "There is no carriage here\n",
      "The Herr is not expected after all\n",
      "He will now come on to Bukovina, and return tomorrow or the next day\n",
      "better the next day\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up\n",
      "Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach\n",
      "I could see from the flash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals\n",
      "They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us\n",
      "I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us\n",
      "He said to the driver\n",
      "You are early tonight, my friend\n",
      "The man stammered in reply\n",
      "The English Herr was in a hurry, to which the stranger replied\n",
      "That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina\n",
      "You cannot deceive me, my friend\n",
      "I know too much, and my horses are swift\n",
      "As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth, with very red lips and sharplooking teeth, as white as ivory\n",
      "One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burgers Lenore\n",
      "Denn die Todten reiten schnell\n",
      "The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a gleaming smile\n",
      "The passenger turned his face away, at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself\n",
      "Give me the Herrs luggage, said the driver\n",
      "and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calèche\n",
      "Then I descended from the side of the coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel\n",
      "his strength must have been prodigious\n",
      "Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass\n",
      "As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves\n",
      "Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept on their way to Bukovina\n",
      "As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me\n",
      "but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German\n",
      "The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you\n",
      "There is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat, if you should require it\n",
      "I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same\n",
      "I felt a little strangely, and not a little frightened\n",
      "I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey\n",
      "The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road\n",
      "It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again\n",
      "and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so\n",
      "I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay\n",
      "Byandby, however, as I was curious to know how time was passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch\n",
      "it was within a few minutes of midnight\n",
      "This gave me a sort of shock, for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences\n",
      "I waited with a sick feeling of suspense\n",
      "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road\n",
      "a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear\n",
      "The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night\n",
      "At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright\n",
      "Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling\n",
      "that of wolves\n",
      "which affected both the horses and myself in the same way\n",
      "for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting\n",
      "In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them\n",
      "He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horsetamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled\n",
      "The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace\n",
      "This time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right\n",
      "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel\n",
      "and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side\n",
      "Though we were in shelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along\n",
      "It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket\n",
      "The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew fainter as we went on our way\n",
      "The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side\n",
      "I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear\n",
      "The driver, however, was not in the least disturbed\n",
      "he kept turning his head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness\n",
      "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame\n",
      "The driver saw it at the same moment\n",
      "he at once checked the horses, and, jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness\n",
      "I did not know what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer\n",
      "but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took his seat, and we resumed our journey\n",
      "I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare\n",
      "Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness around us I could watch the drivers motions\n",
      "He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose\n",
      "it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all\n",
      "and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device\n",
      "Once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same\n",
      "This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness\n",
      "Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle\n",
      "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright\n",
      "I could not see any cause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether\n",
      "but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pineclad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair\n",
      "They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled\n",
      "For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear\n",
      "It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import\n",
      "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them\n",
      "The horses jumped about and reared, and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see\n",
      "but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side\n",
      "and they had perforce to remain within it\n",
      "I called to the coachman to come, for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach\n",
      "I shouted and beat the side of the calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap\n",
      "How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway\n",
      "As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still\n",
      "Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness\n",
      "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the wolves had disappeared\n",
      "This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move\n",
      "The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon\n",
      "We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main always ascending\n",
      "Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky\n",
      "CHAPTER II  JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL\n",
      "continued   I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place\n",
      "In the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is\n",
      "I have not yet been able to see it by daylight\n",
      "When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight\n",
      "Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength\n",
      "His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen\n",
      "Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone\n",
      "I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather\n",
      "As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins\n",
      "the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings\n",
      "I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do\n",
      "Of bell or knocker there was no sign\n",
      "through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate\n",
      "The time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon me\n",
      "What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people\n",
      "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked\n",
      "Was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner\n",
      "Solicitors clerk\n",
      "Mina would not like that\n",
      "for just before leaving London I got word that my examination was successful\n",
      "and I am now a fullblown solicitor\n",
      "I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if I were awake\n",
      "It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork\n",
      "But my flesh answered the pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived\n",
      "I was indeed awake and among the Carpathians\n",
      "All I could do now was to be patient, and to wait the coming of the morning\n",
      "Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light\n",
      "Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back\n",
      "A key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back\n",
      "Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere\n",
      "He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door\n",
      "The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation\n",
      "Welcome to my house\n",
      "Enter freely and of your own will\n",
      "He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone\n",
      "The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice\n",
      "more like the hand of a dead than a living man\n",
      "Again he said\n",
      "Welcome to my house\n",
      "Come freely\n",
      "and leave something of the happiness you bring\n",
      "The strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was speaking\n",
      "so to make sure, I said interrogatively\n",
      "Count Dracula\n",
      "He bowed in a courtly way as he replied\n",
      "I am Dracula\n",
      "and I bid you welcome, Mr\n",
      "Harker, to my house\n",
      "the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest\n",
      "As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage\n",
      "he had carried it in before I could forestall him\n",
      "I protested but he insisted\n",
      "Nay, sir, you are my guest\n",
      "It is late, and my people are not available\n",
      "Let me see to your comfort myself\n",
      "He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily\n",
      "At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared\n",
      "The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort\n",
      "Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter\n",
      "It was a welcome sight\n",
      "for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire,\n",
      "also added to but lately, for the top logs were fresh\n",
      "which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney\n",
      "The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the door\n",
      "You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your toilet\n",
      "I trust you will find all you wish\n",
      "When you are ready, come into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared\n",
      "The light and warmth and the Counts courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears\n",
      "Having then reached my normal state, I discovered that I was half famished with hunger\n",
      "so making a hasty toilet, I went into the other room\n",
      "I found supper already laid out\n",
      "My host, who stood on one side of the great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of his hand to the table, and said\n",
      "I pray you, be seated and sup how you please\n",
      "You will, I trust, excuse me that I do not join you\n",
      "but I have dined already, and I do not sup\n",
      "I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr\n",
      "Hawkins had entrusted to me\n",
      "He opened it and read it gravely\n",
      "then, with a charming smile, he handed it to me to read\n",
      "One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure\n",
      "I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come\n",
      "but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence\n",
      "He is a young man, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition\n",
      "He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service\n",
      "He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take your instructions in all matters\n",
      "The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken\n",
      "This, with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was my supper\n",
      "During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had experienced\n",
      "By this time I had finished my supper, and by my hosts desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke\n",
      "I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy\n",
      "His face was a strong\n",
      "a very strong\n",
      "aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils\n",
      "with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere\n",
      "His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion\n",
      "The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruellooking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth\n",
      "these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years\n",
      "For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed\n",
      "the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin\n",
      "The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor\n",
      "Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine\n",
      "but seeing them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather coarse\n",
      "broad, with squat fingers\n",
      "Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm\n",
      "The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point\n",
      "As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder\n",
      "It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal\n",
      "The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back\n",
      "and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace\n",
      "We were both silent for a while\n",
      "and as I looked towards the window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn\n",
      "There seemed a strange stillness over everything\n",
      "but as I listened I heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves\n",
      "The Counts eyes gleamed, and he said\n",
      "Listen to them\n",
      "the children of the night\n",
      "What music they make\n",
      "Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he added\n",
      "Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter\n",
      "Then he rose and said\n",
      "But you must be tired\n",
      "Your bedroom is all ready, and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will\n",
      "I have to be away till the afternoon\n",
      "so sleep well and dream well\n",
      "With a courteous bow, he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom\n",
      "\n",
      "I am all in a sea of wonders\n",
      "I fear\n",
      "I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul\n",
      "God keep me, if only for the sake of those dear to me\n",
      "It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the last twentyfour hours\n",
      "I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my own accord\n",
      "When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth\n",
      "There was a card on the table, on which was written\n",
      "I have to be absent for a while\n",
      "Do not wait for me\n",
      "D\n",
      "I set to and enjoyed a hearty meal\n",
      "When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I might let the servants know I had finished\n",
      "but I could not find one\n",
      "There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me\n",
      "The table service is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value\n",
      "The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old, though in excellent order\n",
      "I saw something like them in Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten\n",
      "But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror\n",
      "There is not even a toilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair\n",
      "I have not yet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves\n",
      "Some time after I had finished my meal\n",
      "I do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six oclock when I had it\n",
      "I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Counts permission\n",
      "There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing materials\n",
      "so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of library\n",
      "The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked\n",
      "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers\n",
      "A table in the centre was littered with English magazines and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date\n",
      "The books were of the most varied kind\n",
      "history, geography, politics, political economy, botany, geology, law\n",
      "all relating to England and English life and customs and manners\n",
      "There were even such books of reference as the London Directory, the Red and Blue books, Whitakers Almanac, the Army and Navy Lists, and\n",
      "it somehow gladdened my heart to see it\n",
      "the Law List\n",
      "Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count entered\n",
      "He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good nights rest\n",
      "Then he went on\n",
      "I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that will interest you\n",
      "These companions\n",
      "and he laid his hand on some of the books\n",
      "have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours of pleasure\n",
      "Through them I have come to know your great England\n",
      "and to know her is to love her\n",
      "I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is\n",
      "as yet I only know your tongue through books\n",
      "To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak\n",
      "But, Count, I said, you know and speak English thoroughly\n",
      "He bowed gravely\n",
      "I thank you, my friend, for your all tooflattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel\n",
      "True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them\n",
      "Indeed, I said, you speak excellently\n",
      "Not so, he answered\n",
      "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger\n",
      "That is not enough for me\n",
      "Here I am noble\n",
      "I am boyar\n",
      "the common people know me, and I am master\n",
      "But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one\n",
      "men know him not\n",
      "and to know not is to care not for\n",
      "I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, Ha, ha\n",
      "a stranger\n",
      "I have been so long master that I would be master still\n",
      "or at least that none other should be master of me\n",
      "You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London\n",
      "You shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation\n",
      "and I would that you tell me when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking\n",
      "I am sorry that I had to be away so long today\n",
      "but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand\n",
      "Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose\n",
      "He answered Yes, certainly, and added\n",
      "You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish to go\n",
      "There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand\n",
      "I said I was sure of this, and then he went on\n",
      "We are in Transylvania\n",
      "and Transylvania is not England\n",
      "Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things\n",
      "Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange things there may be\n",
      "This led to much conversation\n",
      "and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talkings sake, I asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice\n",
      "Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand\n",
      "but generally he answered all I asked most frankly\n",
      "Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames\n",
      "He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year\n",
      "last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway\n",
      "a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed\n",
      "That treasure has been hidden, he went on, in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt\n",
      "for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk\n",
      "Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders\n",
      "In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them\n",
      "men and women, the aged and the children too\n",
      "and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches\n",
      "When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil\n",
      "But how, said I, can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look\n",
      "The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely\n",
      "he answered\n",
      "Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool\n",
      "Those flames only appear on one night\n",
      "and on that night no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors\n",
      "And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know what to do\n",
      "Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work\n",
      "Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again\n",
      "There you are right, I said\n",
      "I know no more than the dead where even to look for them\n",
      "Then we drifted into other matters\n",
      "Come, he said at last, tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me\n",
      "With an apology for my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag\n",
      "Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark\n",
      "The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaws Guide\n",
      "When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table\n",
      "and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts\n",
      "He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings\n",
      "He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did\n",
      "When I remarked this, he answered\n",
      "Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should\n",
      "When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan\n",
      "nay, pardon me, I fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic first\n",
      "my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me\n",
      "He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins\n",
      "We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at Purfleet\n",
      "When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to Mr\n",
      "Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place\n",
      "I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here\n",
      "At Purfleet, on a byroad, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale\n",
      "It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years\n",
      "The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with rust\n",
      "The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old Quatre Face, as the house is foursided, agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass\n",
      "It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned\n",
      "There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, darklooking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fairsized stream\n",
      "The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron\n",
      "It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or church\n",
      "I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points\n",
      "The house has been added to, but in a very straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great\n",
      "There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum\n",
      "It is not, however, visible from the grounds\n",
      "When I had finished, he said\n",
      "I am glad that it is old and big\n",
      "I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me\n",
      "A house cannot be made habitable in a day\n",
      "and, after all, how few days go to make up a century\n",
      "I rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times\n",
      "We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead\n",
      "I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay\n",
      "I am no longer young\n",
      "and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned to mirth\n",
      "Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken\n",
      "the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements\n",
      "I love the shade and the shadow, and would be alone with my thoughts when I may\n",
      "Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine\n",
      "Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together\n",
      "He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of the books around me\n",
      "One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if that map had been much used\n",
      "On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated\n",
      "the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast\n",
      "It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned\n",
      "he said\n",
      "still at your books\n",
      "But you must not work always\n",
      "I am informed that your supper is ready\n",
      "He took my arm, and we went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table\n",
      "The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from home\n",
      "But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate\n",
      "After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour after hour\n",
      "I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in every way\n",
      "I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me\n",
      "but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide\n",
      "They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide\n",
      "any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it\n",
      "All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air\n",
      "Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said\n",
      "Why, there is the morning again\n",
      "How remiss I am to let you stay up so long\n",
      "You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us, and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me\n",
      "I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice\n",
      "my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky\n",
      "So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of this day\n",
      "I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse\n",
      "but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I cannot but feel uneasy\n",
      "I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come\n",
      "It may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on me\n",
      "but would that that were all\n",
      "If there were any one to talk to I could bear it, but there is no one\n",
      "I have only the Count to speak with, and he\n",
      "I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place\n",
      "Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be\n",
      "it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run riot with me\n",
      "If it does I am lost\n",
      "Let me say at once how I stand\n",
      "or seem to\n",
      "I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up\n",
      "I had hung my shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave\n",
      "Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the Counts voice saying to me, Goodmorning\n",
      "I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me\n",
      "In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice it at the moment\n",
      "Having answered the Counts salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken\n",
      "This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder\n",
      "But there was no reflection of him in the mirror\n",
      "The whole room behind me was displayed\n",
      "but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself\n",
      "This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near\n",
      "but at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin\n",
      "I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster\n",
      "When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat\n",
      "I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix\n",
      "It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there\n",
      "Take care, he said, take care how you cut yourself\n",
      "It is more dangerous than you think in this country\n",
      "Then seizing the shaving glass, he went on And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief\n",
      "It is a foul bauble of mans vanity\n",
      "Away with it\n",
      "and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below\n",
      "Then he withdrew without a word\n",
      "It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watchcase or the bottom of the shavingpot, which is fortunately of metal\n",
      "When I went into the diningroom, breakfast was prepared\n",
      "but I could not find the Count anywhere\n",
      "So I breakfasted alone\n",
      "It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink\n",
      "He must be a very peculiar man\n",
      "After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle\n",
      "I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South\n",
      "The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it\n",
      "The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice\n",
      "A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything\n",
      "As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm\n",
      "Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests\n",
      "But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further\n",
      "doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and bolted\n",
      "In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit\n",
      "The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner\n",
      "CHAPTER III  JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL\n",
      "continued   When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me\n",
      "I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find\n",
      "but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings\n",
      "When I look back after a few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap\n",
      "When, however, the conviction had come to me that I was helpless I sat down quietly\n",
      "as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life\n",
      "and began to think over what was best to be done\n",
      "I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion\n",
      "Of one thing only am I certain\n",
      "that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count\n",
      "He knows well that I am imprisoned\n",
      "and as he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts\n",
      "So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes open\n",
      "I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits\n",
      "and if the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through\n",
      "I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned\n",
      "He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed\n",
      "This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought\n",
      "that there were no servants in the house\n",
      "When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the diningroom, I was assured of it\n",
      "for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them\n",
      "This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here\n",
      "This is a terrible thought\n",
      "for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence\n",
      "How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me\n",
      "What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash\n",
      "Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck\n",
      "for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it\n",
      "It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help\n",
      "Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort\n",
      "Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it\n",
      "In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand\n",
      "Tonight he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way\n",
      "I must be very careful, however, not to awake his suspicion\n",
      "I have had a long talk with the Count\n",
      "I asked him a few questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully\n",
      "In his speaking of things and people, and especially of battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all\n",
      "This he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his fate\n",
      "Whenever he spoke of his house he always said we, and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking\n",
      "I wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating\n",
      "It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country\n",
      "He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength\n",
      "One thing he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can\n",
      "for it tells in its way the story of his race\n",
      "We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship\n",
      "Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come\n",
      "Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert\n",
      "Fools, fools\n",
      "What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins\n",
      "He held up his arms\n",
      "Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race\n",
      "that we were proud\n",
      "that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back\n",
      "Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier\n",
      "that the Honfoglalas was completed there\n",
      "And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkeyland\n",
      "ay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless\n",
      "Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the bloody sword, or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King\n",
      "When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent\n",
      "Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground\n",
      "This was a Dracula indeed\n",
      "Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them\n",
      "Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkeyland\n",
      "who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph\n",
      "They said that he thought only of himself\n",
      "what good are peasants without a leader\n",
      "Where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it\n",
      "Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free\n",
      "Ah, young sir, the Szekelys\n",
      "and the Dracula as their hearts blood, their brains, and their swords\n",
      "can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach\n",
      "The warlike days are over\n",
      "Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace\n",
      "and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told\n",
      "It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed\n",
      ", this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the Arabian Nights, for everything has to break off at cockcrow\n",
      "or like the ghost of Hamlets father\n",
      "bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt\n",
      "I must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them\n",
      "Last evening when the Count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business\n",
      "I had spent the day wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examined in at Lincolns Inn\n",
      "There was a certain method in the Counts inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence\n",
      "the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me\n",
      "First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more\n",
      "I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest\n",
      "He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor\n",
      "I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he said\n",
      "I shall illustrate\n",
      "Your friend and mine, Mr\n",
      "Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London\n",
      "Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only\n",
      "and as one of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest\n",
      "Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports\n",
      "I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble\n",
      "But, said he, I could be at liberty to direct myself\n",
      "Is it not so\n",
      "Of course, I replied\n",
      "and such is often done by men of business, who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person\n",
      "he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against\n",
      "I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee\n",
      "For a man who was never in the country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful\n",
      "When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books available, he suddenly stood up and said\n",
      "Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr\n",
      "Peter Hawkins, or to any other\n",
      "It was with some bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody\n",
      "Then write now, my young friend, he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other\n",
      "and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now\n",
      "Do you wish me to stay so long\n",
      "I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought\n",
      "I desire it much\n",
      "nay, I will take no refusal\n",
      "When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted\n",
      "I have not stinted\n",
      "Is it not so\n",
      "What could I do but bow acceptance\n",
      "Hawkinss interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself\n",
      "and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice\n",
      "The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way\n",
      "I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters\n",
      "It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them\n",
      "Is it not so\n",
      "As he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes\n",
      "They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it\n",
      "So I determined to write only formal notes now, but to write fully to Mr\n",
      "Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he did see it\n",
      "When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table\n",
      "Then he took up my two and placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table\n",
      "I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could\n",
      "One of the letters was directed to Samuel F\n",
      "Billington, No\n",
      "7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna\n",
      "the third was to Coutts  Co\n",
      ", London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock  Billreuth, bankers, BudaPesth\n",
      "The second and fourth were unsealed\n",
      "I was just about to look at them when I saw the doorhandle move\n",
      "I sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room\n",
      "He took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said\n",
      "I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening\n",
      "You will, I hope, find all things as you wish\n",
      "At the door he turned, and after a moments pause said\n",
      "Let me advise you, my dear young friend\n",
      "nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle\n",
      "It is old, and has many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely\n",
      "Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe\n",
      "But if you be not careful in this respect, then\n",
      "He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them\n",
      "I quite understood\n",
      "my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me\n",
      "I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question\n",
      "I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not\n",
      "I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed\n",
      "I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams\n",
      "and there it shall remain\n",
      "When he left me I went to my room\n",
      "After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South\n",
      "There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard\n",
      "Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night\n",
      "I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me\n",
      "It is destroying my nerve\n",
      "I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings\n",
      "God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place\n",
      "I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day\n",
      "In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness\n",
      "The mere beauty seemed to cheer me\n",
      "there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew\n",
      "As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Counts own room would look out\n",
      "The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stonemullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete\n",
      "but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there\n",
      "I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out\n",
      "What I saw was the Counts head coming out from the window\n",
      "I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms\n",
      "In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many opportunities of studying\n",
      "I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner\n",
      "But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings\n",
      "At first I could not believe my eyes\n",
      "I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow\n",
      "but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion\n",
      "I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall\n",
      "What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man\n",
      "I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me\n",
      "I am in fear\n",
      "in awful fear\n",
      "and there is no escape for me\n",
      "I am encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion\n",
      "He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left\n",
      "He vanished into some hole or window\n",
      "When his head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail\n",
      "the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight\n",
      "I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than I had dared to do as yet\n",
      "I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors\n",
      "They were all locked, as I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new\n",
      "but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally\n",
      "I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains\n",
      "but the door was locked, and the key was gone\n",
      "That key must be in the Counts room\n",
      "I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and escape\n",
      "I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them\n",
      "One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and motheaten\n",
      "At last, however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure\n",
      "I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door rested on the floor\n",
      "Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that I could enter\n",
      "I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down\n",
      "From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south\n",
      "On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice\n",
      "The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured\n",
      "To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone\n",
      "This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of comfort than any I had seen\n",
      "The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth\n",
      "My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble\n",
      "Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me\n",
      "Here I am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many blushes, her illspelt loveletter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last\n",
      "It is nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance\n",
      "And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill\n",
      "God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced\n",
      "Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past\n",
      "Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already\n",
      "If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me\n",
      "that to him alone I can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose\n",
      "merciful God\n",
      "Let me be calm, for out of that way lies madness indeed\n",
      "I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me\n",
      "Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say\n",
      "My tablets\n",
      "quick, my tablets\n",
      "Tis meet that I put it down, etc\n",
      ",  for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose\n",
      "The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me\n",
      "The Counts mysterious warning frightened me at the time\n",
      "it frightens me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me\n",
      "I shall fear to doubt what he may say\n",
      "When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy\n",
      "The Counts warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it\n",
      "The sense of sleep was upon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider\n",
      "The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me\n",
      "I determined not to return tonight to the gloomhaunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars\n",
      "I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep\n",
      "I suppose I must have fallen asleep\n",
      "I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly real\n",
      "so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep\n",
      "I was not alone\n",
      "The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it\n",
      "I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust\n",
      "In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner\n",
      "I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor\n",
      "They came close to me, and looked at me for some time, and then whispered together\n",
      "Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon\n",
      "The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires\n",
      "I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the moment how or where\n",
      "All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips\n",
      "There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear\n",
      "I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips\n",
      "It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Minas eyes and cause her pain\n",
      "but it is the truth\n",
      "They whispered together, and then they all three laughed\n",
      "such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips\n",
      "It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand\n",
      "The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on\n",
      "Go on\n",
      "You are first, and we shall follow\n",
      "yours is the right to begin\n",
      "The other added\n",
      "He is young and strong\n",
      "there are kisses for us all\n",
      "I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation\n",
      "The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me\n",
      "Sweet it was in one sense, honeysweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood\n",
      "I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes\n",
      "The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating\n",
      "There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth\n",
      "Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat\n",
      "Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck\n",
      "Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer\n",
      "I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there\n",
      "I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited\n",
      "waited with beating heart\n",
      "But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning\n",
      "I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury\n",
      "As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giants power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion\n",
      "But the Count\n",
      "Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to the demons of the pit\n",
      "His eyes were positively blazing\n",
      "The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them\n",
      "His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires\n",
      "the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal\n",
      "With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back\n",
      "it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves\n",
      "In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said\n",
      "How dare you touch him, any of you\n",
      "How dare you cast eyes on him when I had forbidden it\n",
      "Back, I tell you all\n",
      "This man belongs to me\n",
      "Beware how you meddle with him, or youll have to deal with me\n",
      "The fair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him\n",
      "You yourself never loved\n",
      "you never love\n",
      "On this the other women joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear\n",
      "it seemed like the pleasure of fiends\n",
      "Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively, and said in a soft whisper\n",
      "Yes, I too can love\n",
      "you yourselves can tell it from the past\n",
      "Is it not so\n",
      "Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will\n",
      "go\n",
      "I must awaken him, for there is work to be done\n",
      "Are we to have nothing tonight\n",
      "said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it\n",
      "For answer he nodded his head\n",
      "One of the women jumped forward and opened it\n",
      "If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a halfsmothered child\n",
      "The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with horror\n",
      "but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful bag\n",
      "There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me without my noticing\n",
      "They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away\n",
      "Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious\n",
      "CHAPTER IV  JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL\n",
      "continued   I awoke in my own bed\n",
      "If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must have carried me here\n",
      "I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but could not arrive at any unquestionable result\n",
      "To be sure, there were certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit\n",
      "My watch was still unwound, and I am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and many such details\n",
      "But these things are no proof, for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or another, I had certainly been much upset\n",
      "I must watch for proof\n",
      "Of one thing I am glad if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact\n",
      "I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked\n",
      "He would have taken or destroyed it\n",
      "As I look round this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who were\n",
      "who waiting to suck my blood\n",
      "I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I must know the truth\n",
      "When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it closed\n",
      "It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered\n",
      "I could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside\n",
      "I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise\n",
      "I am surely in the toils\n",
      "Last night the Count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at Bistritz\n",
      "I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I am so absolutely in his power\n",
      "and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger\n",
      "He knows that I know too much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him\n",
      "my only chance is to prolong my opportunities\n",
      "Something may occur which will give me a chance to escape\n",
      "I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him\n",
      "He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends\n",
      "and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion\n",
      "I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters\n",
      "He calculated a minute, and then said\n",
      "The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June 29\n",
      "I know now the span of my life\n",
      "God help me\n",
      "There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home\n",
      "A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are encamped in the courtyard\n",
      "These Szgany are gipsies\n",
      "I have notes of them in my book\n",
      "They are peculiar to this part of the world, though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over\n",
      "There are thousands of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law\n",
      "They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar, and call themselves by his name\n",

      "A minute later I went over and tried it, and the door was locked\n",
      "When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa\n",
      "He was very courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been sleeping, he said\n",
      "So, my friend, you are tired\n",

      "Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda, relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that might be useful to me were I once outside the castle\n",
      "I sat and pondered awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes\n",
      "The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and rug\n",
      "I could find no trace of them anywhere\n",
      "This looked like some new scheme of villainy\n",

      "With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great leiterwagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nailstudded belt, dirty sheepskin, and high boots\n",
      "They had also their long staves in hand\n",
      "I ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them\n",
      "Again a shock my door was fastened on the outside\n",
      "Then I ran to the window and cried to them\n",
      "They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the hetman of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed\n",
      "Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me\n",
      "They resolutely turned away\n",
      "The leiterwagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope\n",
      "these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved\n",
      "When they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on it for luck, lazily went each to his horses head\n",
      "Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance\n",
      "Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room\n",
      "As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south\n",
      "I thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on\n",
      "The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind\n",
      "I know it, for now and then I hear a faraway muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy\n",
      "I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Counts window\n",
      "I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge\n",
      "It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had seen the women take away\n",
      "There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too\n",
      "This, then, is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me\n",
      "It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminals right and consolation\n",
      "I thought I would watch for the Counts return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window\n",
      "Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight\n",
      "They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way\n",
      "I watched them with a sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me\n",
      "I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more fully the aërial gambolling\n",
      "Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight\n",
      "Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight\n",
      "I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts\n",
      "nay, my very soul was struggling, and my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call\n",
      "I was becoming hypnotised\n",
      "Quicker and quicker danced the dust\n",
      "the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond\n",
      "More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes\n",
      "And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place\n",
      "The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed\n",
      "I fled, and felt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly\n",
      "When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Counts room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed\n",
      "and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me\n",
      "With a beating heart, I tried the door\n",
      "but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing\n",
      "I sat down and simply cried\n",
      "As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without\n",
      "the agonised cry of a woman\n",
      "I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between the bars\n",
      "There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running\n",
      "She was leaning against a corner of the gateway\n",
      "When she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace\n",
      "Monster, give me my child\n",
      "She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart\n",
      "Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion\n",
      "Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door\n",
      "Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper\n",
      "His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves\n",
      "Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pentup dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard\n",
      "There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short\n",
      "Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips\n",
      "I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead\n",
      "What shall I do\n",
      "what can I do\n",
      "How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear\n",
      "No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be\n",
      "When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there\n",
      "My fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth\n",
      "I must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me\n",
      "Last night one of my postdated letters went to post, the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth\n",
      "Let me not think of it\n",
      "It has always been at nighttime that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear\n",
      "I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight\n",
      "Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep\n",
      "If I could only get into his room\n",
      "But there is no possible way\n",
      "The door is always locked, no way for me\n",
      "Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it\n",
      "Where his body has gone why may not another body go\n",
      "I have seen him myself crawl from his window\n",
      "Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window\n",
      "The chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still\n",
      "I shall risk it\n",
      "At the worst it can only be death\n",
      "and a mans death is not a calfs, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me\n",
      "God help me in my task\n",
      "Goodbye, Mina, if I fail\n",
      "goodbye, my faithful friend and second father\n",
      "goodbye, all, and last of all Mina\n",
      "I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room\n",
      "I must put down every detail in order\n",
      "I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side\n",
      "The stones are big and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them\n",
      "I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way\n",
      "I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it\n",
      "I knew pretty well the direction and distance of the Counts window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available\n",
      "I did not feel dizzy\n",
      "I suppose I was too excited\n",
      "and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash\n",
      "I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window\n",
      "Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery\n",
      "The room was empty\n",
      "It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used\n",
      "the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust\n",
      "I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere\n",
      "The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner\n",
      "gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground\n",
      "None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old\n",
      "There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained\n",
      "At one corner of the room was a heavy door\n",
      "I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts would be in vain\n",
      "It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down\n",
      "I descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry\n",
      "At the bottom there was a dark, tunnellike passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour of old earth newly turned\n",
      "As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier\n",
      "At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a graveyard\n",
      "The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks\n",
      "There was nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none\n",
      "Then I went over every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance\n",
      "I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to my very soul\n",
      "Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust\n",
      "in the third, however, I made a discovery\n",
      "There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count\n",
      "He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which\n",
      "for the eyes were open and stony, but without the glassiness of death\n",
      "and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor\n",
      "the lips were as red as ever\n",
      "But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart\n",
      "I bent over him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain\n",
      "He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours\n",
      "By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there\n",
      "I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Counts room by the window, crawled again up the castle wall\n",
      "Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think\n",
      "\n",
      "Today is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes\n",
      "As he went down the wall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him\n",
      "but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand would have any effect on him\n",
      "I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see those weird sisters\n",
      "I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep\n",
      "I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said\n",
      "Tomorrow, my friend, we must part\n",
      "You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet\n",
      "Your letter home has been despatched\n",
      "tomorrow I shall not be here, but all shall be ready for your journey\n",
      "In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some Slovaks\n",
      "When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz\n",
      "But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula\n",
      "I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity\n",
      "It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster, so asked him pointblank\n",
      "Why may I not go tonight\n",
      "Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission\n",
      "But I would walk with pleasure\n",
      "I want to get away at once\n",
      "He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness\n",
      "And your baggage\n",
      "I do not care about it\n",
      "I can send for it some other time\n",
      "The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real\n",
      "You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our boyars Welcome the coming\n",
      "speed the parting guest\n",
      "Come with me, my dear young friend\n",
      "Not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it\n",
      "With a stately gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped\n",
      "Close at hand came the howling of many wolves\n",
      "It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor\n",
      "After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open\n",
      "To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked\n",
      "Suspiciously, I looked all round, but could see no key of any kind\n",
      "As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier\n",
      "their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door\n",
      "I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless\n",
      "With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing\n",
      "But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Counts body stood in the gap\n",
      "Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom\n",
      "I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation\n",
      "There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out\n",
      "Shut the door\n",
      "I shall wait till morning\n",
      "and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment\n",
      "With one sweep of his powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places\n",
      "In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went to my own room\n",
      "The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand to me\n",
      "with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of\n",
      "When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a whispering at my door\n",
      "I went to it softly and listened\n",
      "Unless my ears deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count\n",
      "Back, back, to your own place\n",
      "Your time is not yet come\n",
      "Have patience\n",
      "Tonight is mine\n",
      "Tomorrow night is yours\n",
      "There was a low, sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips\n",
      "As I appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away\n",
      "I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees\n",
      "It is then so near the end\n",
      "tomorrow\n",
      "Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear\n",
      "These may be the last words I ever write in this diary\n",
      "I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me ready\n",
      "At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning had come\n",
      "Then came the welcome cockcrow, and I felt that I was safe\n",
      "With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall\n",
      "I had seen that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me\n",
      "With hands that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts\n",
      "But the door would not move\n",
      "Despair seized me\n",
      "I pulled, and pulled, at the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its casement\n",
      "I could see the bolt shot\n",
      "It had been locked after I left the Count\n",
      "Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Counts room\n",
      "He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils\n",
      "Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the Counts room\n",
      "It was empty, but that was as I expected\n",
      "I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained\n",
      "I went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel\n",
      "I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought\n",
      "The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home\n",
      "I knew I must reach the body for the key, so I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall\n",
      "and then I saw something which filled my very soul with horror\n",
      "There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey\n",
      "the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath\n",
      "the mouth was redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck\n",
      "Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated\n",
      "It seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood\n",
      "He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his repletion\n",
      "I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact\n",
      "but I had to search, or I was lost\n",
      "The coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three\n",
      "I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the key\n",
      "Then I stopped and looked at the Count\n",
      "There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad\n",
      "This was the being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless\n",
      "The very thought drove me mad\n",
      "A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster\n",
      "There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face\n",
      "But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror\n",
      "The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead\n",
      "The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight\n",
      "The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell\n",
      "I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me\n",
      "As I waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips\n",
      "the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had spoken were coming\n",
      "With a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Counts room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened\n",
      "With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door\n",
      "There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of the locked doors\n",
      "Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo\n",
      "I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance\n",
      "but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying\n",
      "When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast\n",
      "I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely\n",
      "As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth\n",
      "There is a sound of hammering\n",
      "it is the box being nailed down\n",
      "Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them\n",
      "The door is shut, and the chains rattle\n",
      "there is a grinding of the key in the lock\n",
      "I can hear the key withdraw then another door opens and shuts\n",
      "I hear the creaking of lock and bolt\n",
      "in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels, the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the distance\n",
      "I am alone in the castle with those awful women\n",
      "Mina is a woman, and there is nought in common\n",
      "They are devils of the Pit\n",
      "I shall not remain alone with them\n",
      "I shall try to scale the castle wall farther than I have yet attempted\n",
      "I shall take some of the gold with me, lest I want it later\n",
      "I may find a way from this dreadful place\n",
      "And then away for home\n",
      "away to the quickest and nearest train\n",
      "away from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet\n",
      "At least Gods mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the precipice is steep and high\n",
      "At its foot a man may sleep\n",
      "Goodbye, all\n",
      "CHAPTER V  Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra\n",
      "My dearest Lucy,\n",
      "Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed with work\n",
      "The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying\n",
      "I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air\n",
      "I have been working very hard lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathans studies, and I have been practising shorthand very assiduously\n",
      "When we are married I shall be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard\n",

      "so I said, as lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I wasnt broken to harness at all yet\n",
      "Then he said that he had spoken in a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him\n",
      "He really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldnt help feeling a bit serious too\n",
      "I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid flirt\n",

      "And then, my dear, before I could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking, laying his very heart and soul at my feet\n",
      "He looked so earnest over it that I shall never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest, because he is merry at times\n",
      "I suppose he saw something in my face which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free\n",
      "Lucy, you are an honesthearted girl, I know\n",
      "I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul\n",

      "And if there is Ill never trouble you a hairs breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend\n",

      "Here was I almost making fun of this greathearted, true gentleman\n",

      "I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one\n",

      "Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me\n",

      "My belief is, doctor, he said, that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and ate them raw\n",

      "Maybe its in that wind out over the sea thats bringin with it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts\n",
      "look\n",
      "he cried suddenly\n",
      "Theres something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death\n",

      "His mouth moved as though he were praying\n",
      "After a few minutes silence, he got up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said goodbye, and hobbled off\n",
      "It all touched me, and upset me very much\n",
      "I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spyglass under his arm\n",
      "He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time kept looking at a strange ship\n",

      "CHAPTER VII  CUTTING FROM THE DAILYGRAPH, 8 AUGUST     From a Correspondent\n",
      "One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here, with results both strange and unique\n",
      "The weather had been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of August\n",
      "Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great body of holidaymakers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods, Robin Hoods Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in the neighbourhood of Whitby\n",
      "The steamers Emma and Scarborough made trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of tripping both to and from Whitby\n",
      "The day was unusually fine till the afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of marestails high in the sky to the northwest\n",
      "The wind was then blowing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked No\n",
      "2 light breeze\n",
      "The coastguard on duty at once made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm\n",
      "The approach of sunset was so very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidlycoloured clouds, that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty\n",
      "Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunsetcolour\n",
      "flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold\n",
      "with here and there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes\n",
      "The experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the sketches of the Prelude to the Great Storm will grace the R\n",
      "and R\n",
      "walls in May next\n",
      "More than one captain made up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule, as they term the different classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed\n",
      "The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature\n",
      "There were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers, which usually hug the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but few fishingboats were in sight\n",
      "The only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards\n",
      "The foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger\n",
      "Before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea,      As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean\n",
      "Shortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the great harmony of natures silence\n",
      "A little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to carry a strange, faint, hollow booming\n",
      "Then without warning the tempest broke\n",
      "With a rapidity which, at the time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize, the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed\n",
      "The waves rose in growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster\n",
      "Whitecrested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs\n",
      "others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour\n",
      "The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions\n",
      "It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold\n",
      "To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of seafog came drifting inland\n",
      "white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of seamist swept by\n",
      "At times the mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm\n",
      "Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest\n",
      "the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space\n",
      "here and there a fishingboat, with a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast\n",
      "now and again the white wings of a stormtossed seabird\n",
      "On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried\n",
      "The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea\n",
      "Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishingboat, with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers\n",
      "As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush\n",
      "Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening\n",
      "The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was\n",
      "Between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour\n",
      "It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old salt, she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in hell\n",
      "Then came another rush of seafog, greater than any hitherto\n",
      "a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before\n",
      "The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless\n",
      "The wind suddenly shifted to the northeast, and the remnant of the seafog melted in the blast\n",
      "and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained the safety of the harbour\n",
      "The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship\n",
      "No other form could be seen on deck at all\n",
      "A great awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man\n",
      "However, all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words\n",
      "The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier\n",
      "There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap\n",
      "Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the tophammer came crashing down\n",
      "But, strangest of all, the very instant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand\n",
      "Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones\n",
      "thruffsteans or throughstones, as they call them in the Whitby vernacular\n",
      "actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight\n",
      "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above\n",
      "Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to climb on board\n",
      "The men working the searchlight, after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there\n",
      "The coastguard ran aft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion\n",
      "This seemed to pique general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run\n",
      "It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd\n",
      "When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board\n",
      "By the courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel\n",
      "It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen\n",
      "The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel\n",
      "Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords\n",
      "The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone\n",
      "Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor\n",
      "M\n",
      "Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot Place\n",
      "who came immediately after me, declared, after making examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days\n",
      "In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log\n",
      "The coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth\n",
      "The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court\n",
      "for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict\n",
      "Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand\n",
      "It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death\n",
      "a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca\n",
      "and placed in the mortuary to await inquest\n",
      "Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating\n",
      "crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds\n",
      "I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm\n",
      "Whitby  The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself\n",
      "It turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the Demeter\n",
      "She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a small amount of cargo\n",
      "a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould\n",
      "This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr\n",
      "F\n",
      "Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him\n",
      "The Russian consul, too, acting for the charterparty, took formal possession of the ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc\n",
      "Nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence\n",
      "the officials of the Board of Trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations\n",
      "As the matter is to be a nine days wonder, they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint\n",
      "A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the S\n",
      "C\n",
      ", which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the animal\n",
      "To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found\n",
      "it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town\n",
      "It may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still hiding in terror\n",
      "There are some who look with dread on such a possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it is evidently a fierce brute\n",
      "Early this morning a large dog, a halfbred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found dead in the roadway opposite to its masters yard\n",
      "It had been fighting, and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away, and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw\n",
      "By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been permitted to look over the logbook of the Demeter, which was in order up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men\n",
      "The greatest interest, however, is with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was today produced at the inquest\n",
      "and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across\n",
      "As there is no motive for concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo\n",
      "It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage\n",
      "Of course my statement must be taken cum grano, since I am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for me, time being short\n",

      "Mate getting very impatient with them\n",
      "feared some trouble ahead\n",
      "On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship\n",
      "He said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse, as there was a rainstorm, when he saw a tall, thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companionway, and go along the deck forward, and disappear\n",
      "He followed cautiously, but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed\n",
      "He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may spread\n",
      "To allay it, I shall today search entire ship carefully from stem to stern\n",

      "Lord, help us\n",
      "Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out\n",
      "If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us\n",
      "and God seems to have deserted us\n",
      "At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one there\n",
      "The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing\n",
      "I dared not leave it, so shouted for the mate\n",
      "After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels\n",
      "He looked wildeyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given way\n",
      "He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing the very air might hear It is here\n",
      "I know it, now\n",
      "On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin, and ghastly pale\n",
      "It was in the bows, and looking out\n",
      "I crept behind It, and gave It my knife\n",
      "but the knife went through It, empty as the air\n",
      "And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space\n",
      "Then he went on But It is here, and Ill find It\n",
      "It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes\n",
      "Ill unscrew them one by one and see\n",
      "You work the helm\n",

      "Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake\n",
      "but she got up twice and dressed herself\n",
      "Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed\n",
      "It is a very strange thing, this sleepwalking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any, disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life\n",
      "Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night\n",
      "There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grimlooking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour\n",

      "The funeral of the poor seacaptain today was most touching\n",
      "Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard\n",
      "Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down again\n",
      "We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way\n",
      "The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything\n",
      "Poor Lucy seemed much upset\n",
      "She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her\n",
      "She is quite odd in one thing she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness\n",
      "or if there be, she does not understand it herself\n",
      "There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr\n",
      "Swales was found dead this morning on our seat, his neck being broken\n",
      "He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder\n",
      "Poor dear old man\n",
      "Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes\n",

      "One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog\n",
      "The dog is always with him\n",
      "They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark\n",
      "During the service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and howling\n",
      "Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily\n",
      "but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise\n",
      "It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cats tail when puss is on the warpath\n",
      "Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed\n",
      "The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble\n",
      "It did not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to comfort it\n",
      "Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way\n",

      "When we got in, and had washed our feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into bed\n",

      "me not to say a word to any one, even her mother, about her sleepwalking adventure\n",

      "I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her\n",
      "Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced\n",
      "I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pinpricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood\n",
      "When I apologised and was concerned about it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it\n",
      "Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny\n",
      "We passed a happy day\n",
      "The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool breeze\n",
      "We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs\n",
      "Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the cliffpath and joining her at the gate\n",

      "I must only be patient\n",
      "In the evening we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early\n",
      "Lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once\n",
      "I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any trouble tonight\n",
      "My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out\n",
      "She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest\n",
      "I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window\n",
      "Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning\n",
      "All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur\n",
      "I told her how anxious I was about Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me\n",
      "Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy cant alter facts, it can help to make them more bearable\n",
      "Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before\n",
      "Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window\n",
      "I got up quietly, and pulling aside the blind, looked out\n",
      "It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky\n",
      "merged together in one great, silent mystery\n",
      "was beautiful beyond words\n",
      "Between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles\n",
      "Once or twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey\n",
      "When I came back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully\n",
      "She did not stir again all night\n",
      "On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day\n",
      "Lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner\n",
      "This afternoon she made a funny remark\n",
      "We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do\n",
      "The setting sun, low down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness\n",
      "the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow\n",

      "His red eyes again\n",
      "They are just the same\n",
      "It was such an odd expression, coming apropos of nothing, that it quite startled me\n",
      "I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw that she was in a halfdreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out\n",
      "so I said nothing, but followed her eyes\n",
      "She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated alone\n",
      "I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames\n",
      "but a second look dispelled the illusion\n",
      "The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St\n",
      "Marys Church behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved\n",
      "I called Lucys attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start, but she looked sad all the same\n",
      "it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there\n",
      "We never refer to it\n",
      "so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner\n",
      "Lucy had a headache and went early to bed\n",
      "I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself\n",
      "I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan\n",
      "When coming home\n",
      "it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen\n",
      "I threw a glance up at our window, and saw Lucys head leaning out\n",
      "I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it\n",
      "She did not notice or make any movement whatever\n",
      "Just then, the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window\n",
      "There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windowsill and her eyes shut\n",
      "She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the windowsill, was something that looked like a goodsized bird\n",
      "I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing heavily\n",
      "she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold\n",
      "I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly\n",
      "I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened\n",
      "She looks so sweet as she sleeps\n",
      "but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like\n",
      "I fear she is fretting about something\n",
      "I wish I could find out what it is\n",
      "Rose later than usual\n",

      "We had a happy surprise at breakfast\n",
      "Arthurs father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon\n",
      "Lucy is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once\n",
      "Later on in the day she told me the cause\n",
      "She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her\n",
      "Poor dear, sweet lady\n",
      "She confided to me that she has got her deathwarrant\n",
      "She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy\n",
      "her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening\n",
      "At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her\n",
      "Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucys sleepwalking\n",

      "I have not had the heart to write\n",
      "Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness\n",

      "I do not understand Lucys fading away as she is doing\n",
      "She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air\n",
      "but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and more languid day by day\n",
      "at night I hear her gasping as if for air\n",
      "I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window\n",
      "Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not\n",
      "she was in a faint\n",
      "When I managed to restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath\n",
      "When I asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away\n",
      "I trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin\n",
      "I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed\n",
      "They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the edges of them are faintly white\n",
      "They are like little white dots with red centres\n",
      "Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them\n",

      "It is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woebegone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly\n",
      "I cannot quite understand it\n",
      "Another change in my patient\n",
      "At five oclock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be\n",
      "He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding\n",
      "When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again\n",
      "I thought it well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open\n",
      "He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill, and is reaping quite a harvest of flies\n",
      "He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider\n",
      "I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me\n",
      "but he would not rise\n",
      "For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of faraway voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me\n",
      "all over\n",
      "He has deserted me\n",
      "No hope for me now unless I do it for myself\n",
      "Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said Doctor, wont you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar\n",
      "I think it would be good for me\n",
      "And the flies\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "The flies like it, too, and I like the flies\n",
      "therefore I like it\n",
      "And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue\n",
      "I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any in the world\n",
      "I wish I could fathom his mind\n",
      "Another change in him\n",
      "I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling\n",
      "As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning\n",
      "It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all\n",
      "I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink\n",
      "As it sank he became less and less frenzied\n",
      "and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor\n",
      "It is wonderful, however, what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him\n",
      "I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do\n",
      "He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar\n",
      "then he took his flybox, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box\n",
      "then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed\n",
      "All this surprised me, so I asked him Are you not going to keep flies any more\n",
      "No, said he\n",
      "I am sick of all that rubbish\n",
      "He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study\n",
      "I wish I could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion\n",
      "there may be a clue after all, if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset\n",
      "Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures\n",
      "as at times the moon does others\n",

      "so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucys weak condition, might be disastrous to her\n",

      "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram\n",

      "I have for myself thoughts at the present\n",
      "Later I shall unfold to you\n",
      "Why not now\n",
      "It may do some good\n",
      "we may arrive at some decision\n",

      "My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened\n",
      "while the milk of its motherearth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you Look\n",
      "hes good corn\n",
      "he will make good crop when the time comes\n",
      "I did not see the application, and told him so\n",
      "For reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said The good husbandman tell you so then because he knows, but not till then\n",
      "But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow\n",
      "that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work of their life\n",
      "See you now, friend John\n",
      "I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout\n",
      "if he sprout at all, theres some promise\n",
      "and I wait till the ear begins to swell\n",
      "He broke off, for he evidently saw that I understood\n",
      "Then he went on, and very gravely\n",
      "You were always a careful student, and your casebook was ever more full than the rest\n",
      "You were only student then\n",
      "now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail\n",
      "Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker\n",
      "Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be\n",

      "Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess\n",
      "We learn from failure, not from success\n",
      "When I described Lucys symptoms\n",
      "the same as before, but infinitely more marked\n",
      "he looked very grave, but said nothing\n",
      "He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade, as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft\n",
      "When we were shown in, Mrs\n",
      "Westenra met us\n",
      "She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I expected to find her\n",
      "Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors\n",
      "Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal\n",
      "even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached\n",
      "do not seem to reach her\n",
      "It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact\n",
      "If this be an ordered selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of\n",
      "I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required\n",
      "She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life\n",
      "Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucys room\n",
      "If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her today\n",
      "She was ghastly, chalkily pale\n",
      "the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently\n",
      "her breathing was painful to see or hear\n",
      "Van Helsings face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose\n",
      "Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent\n",
      "Then Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room\n",
      "The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door, which was open\n",
      "Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door\n",
      "he said\n",
      "this is dreadful\n",
      "There is no time to be lost\n",
      "She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the hearts action as it should be\n",
      "There must be transfusion of blood at once\n",
      "Is it you or me\n",
      "I am younger and stronger, Professor\n",
      "It must be me\n",
      "Then get ready at once\n",
      "I will bring up my bag\n",
      "I am prepared\n",
      "I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the halldoor\n",
      "When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in\n",
      "He rushed up to me, saying in an eager whisper\n",
      "Jack, I was so anxious\n",
      "I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony\n",
      "The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for myself\n",
      "Is not that gentleman Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing\n",
      "I am so thankful to you, sir, for coming\n",
      "When first the Professors eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time\n",
      "but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed\n",
      "Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand\n",
      "Sir, you have come in time\n",
      "You are the lover of our dear miss\n",
      "She is bad, very, very bad\n",
      "Nay, my child, do not go like that\n",
      "For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting\n",
      "You are to help her\n",
      "You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help\n",
      "What can I do\n",
      "asked Arthur hoarsely\n",
      "Tell me, and I shall do it\n",
      "My life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for her\n",
      "The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer\n",
      "My young sir, I do not ask so much as that\n",
      "not the last\n",
      "What shall I do\n",
      "There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent\n",
      "Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder\n",
      "he said\n",
      "You are a man, and it is a man we want\n",
      "You are better than me, better than my friend John\n",
      "Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way\n",
      "Young miss is bad, very bad\n",
      "She wants blood, and blood she must have or die\n",
      "My friend John and I have consulted\n",
      "and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood\n",
      "to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him\n",
      "John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than me\n",
      "here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence\n",
      "but, now you are here, you are more good than us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought\n",
      "Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours\n",
      "Arthur turned to him and said\n",
      "If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand\n",
      "He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice\n",
      "said Van Helsing\n",
      "In the notsofaroff you will be happy that you have done all for her you love\n",
      "Come now and be silent\n",
      "You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go\n",
      "and you must leave at my sign\n",
      "Say no word to Madame\n",
      "you know how it is with her\n",
      "There must be no shock\n",
      "any knowledge of this would be one\n",
      "We all went up to Lucys room\n",
      "Arthur by direction remained outside\n",
      "Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing\n",
      "She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort\n",
      "Her eyes spoke to us\n",
      "that was all\n",
      "Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight\n",
      "Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily\n",
      "Now, little miss, here is your medicine\n",
      "Drink it off, like a good child\n",
      "See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy\n",
      "She had made the effort with success\n",
      "It astonished me how long the drug took to act\n",
      "This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness\n",
      "The time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids\n",
      "At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency\n",
      "and she fell into a deep sleep\n",
      "When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his coat\n",
      "Then he added You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table\n",
      "Friend John, help to me\n",
      "So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her\n",
      "Van Helsing turning to me, said  He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it\n",
      "Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation\n",
      "As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucys cheeks, and through Arthurs growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine\n",
      "After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he was\n",
      "It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucys system must have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her\n",
      "But the Professors face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur\n",
      "I could hear my own heart beat\n",
      "Presently he said in a soft voice Do not stir an instant\n",
      "It is enough\n",
      "You attend him\n",
      "I will look to her\n",
      "When all was over I could see how much Arthur was weakened\n",
      "I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round\n",
      "the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head\n",
      "The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently\n",
      "And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patients head\n",
      "As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat\n",
      "Arthur did not notice it, but I could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsings ways of betraying emotion\n",
      "He said nothing at the moment, but turned to me, saying Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let him lie down a while\n",
      "He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love\n",
      "He must not stay here\n",
      "a moment\n",
      "I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result\n",
      "Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful\n",
      "You have saved her life this time, and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is\n",
      "I shall tell her all when she is well\n",
      "she shall love you none the less for what you have done\n",
      "When Arthur had gone I went back to the room\n",
      "Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger\n",
      "I could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved\n",
      "By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently\n",
      "The velvet band again covered the red mark\n",
      "I asked the Professor in a whisper\n",
      "What do you make of that mark on her throat\n",
      "What do you make of it\n",
      "I have not examined it yet, I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band\n",
      "Just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesomelooking\n",
      "There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and wornlooking, as if by some trituration\n",
      "It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood\n",
      "but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be\n",
      "The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion\n",
      "said Van Helsing\n",
      "Well, said I, I can make nothing of it\n",
      "The Professor stood up\n",
      "I must go back to Amsterdam tonight, he said\n",
      "There are books and things there which I want\n",
      "You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your sight pass from her\n",
      "Shall I have a nurse\n",
      "We are the best nurses, you and I\n",
      "You keep watch all night\n",
      "see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her\n",
      "You must not sleep all the night\n",
      "Later on we can sleep, you and I\n",
      "I shall be back as soon as possible\n",
      "And then we may begin\n",
      "I said\n",
      "What on earth do you mean\n",
      "We shall see\n",
      "he answered, as he hurried out\n",
      "He came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up\n",
      "Remember, she is your charge\n",
      "If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter\n",
      "I sat up all night with Lucy\n",
      "The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked naturally\n",
      "she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation\n",
      "Her spirits even were good, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone\n",
      "When I told Mrs\n",
      "Westenra that Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost poohpoohed the idea, pointing out her daughters renewed strength and excellent spirits\n",
      "I was firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil\n",
      "When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by the bedside\n",
      "She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her eye\n",
      "After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off\n",
      "This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on\n",
      "It was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once\n",
      "You do not want to go to sleep\n",
      "I am afraid\n",
      "Afraid to go to sleep\n",
      "It is the boon we all crave for\n",
      "Ah, not if you were like me\n",
      "if sleep was to you a presage of horror\n",
      "A presage of horror\n",
      "What on earth do you mean\n",
      "I dont know\n",
      "oh, I dont know\n",
      "And that is what is so terrible\n",
      "All this weakness comes to me in sleep\n",
      "until I dread the very thought\n",
      "But, my dear girl, you may sleep tonight\n",
      "I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will happen\n",
      "Ah, I can trust you\n",
      "I seized the opportunity, and said I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once\n",
      "Oh, will you really\n",
      "How good you are to me\n",
      "Then I will sleep\n",
      "And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep\n",
      "All night long I watched by her\n",
      "She never stirred, but slept on and on in a deep, tranquil, lifegiving, healthgiving sleep\n",
      "Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum\n",

      "In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about many things\n",

      "A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham tonight, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning\n",

      "Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port\n",
      "Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning\n",
      "Now, she said, you must stay here\n",

      "I could not but acquiesce, for I was dogtired, and could not have sat up had I tried\n",

      "I seem to feel his presence warm about me\n",
      "I suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills\n",

      "I was conscious of the Professors hand on my head, and started awake all in a second\n",
      "That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate\n",
      "And how is our patient\n",
      "Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me, I answered\n",
      "Come, let us see, he said\n",
      "And together we went into the room\n",
      "The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, catlike tread, over to the bed\n",
      "As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professors low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart\n",
      "As I passed over he moved back, and his exclamation of horror, Gott in Himmel\n",
      "needed no enforcement from his agonised face\n",
      "He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white\n",
      "I felt my knees begin to tremble\n",
      "There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wanlooking than ever\n",
      "Even the lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness\n",
      "Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly\n",
      "he said\n",
      "Bring the brandy\n",
      "I flew to the diningroom, and returned with the decanter\n",
      "He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart\n",
      "He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said\n",
      "It is not too late\n",
      "It beats, though but feebly\n",
      "All our work is undone\n",
      "we must begin again\n",
      "There is no young Arthur here now\n",
      "I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John\n",
      "As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion\n",
      "I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve\n",
      "There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one\n",
      "and so, without a moments delay, we began the operation\n",
      "After a time\n",
      "it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of ones blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling\n",
      "Van Helsing held up a warning finger\n",
      "Do not stir, he said, but I fear that with growing strength she may wake\n",
      "and that would make danger, oh, so much danger\n",
      "But I shall precaution take\n",
      "I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia\n",
      "He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent\n",
      "The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep\n",
      "It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips\n",
      "No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves\n",
      "The Professor watched me critically\n",
      "That will do, he said\n",
      "I remonstrated\n",
      "You took a great deal more from Art\n",
      "To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied\n",
      "He is her lover, her fiancé\n",
      "You have work, much work, to do for her and for others\n",
      "and the present will suffice\n",
      "When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision\n",
      "I laid down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick\n",
      "Byandby he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself\n",
      "As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half whispered\n",
      "Mind, nothing must be said of this\n",
      "If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him\n",
      "It would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too\n",
      "There must be none\n",
      "When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said\n",
      "You are not much the worse\n",
      "Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile\n",
      "then have much breakfast, and come here to me\n",
      "I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were\n",
      "I had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength\n",
      "I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred\n",
      "I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it\n",
      "I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges\n",
      "tiny though they were\n",
      "Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before\n",
      "When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment\n",
      "I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office\n",
      "Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened\n",
      "I tried to keep her amused and interested\n",
      "When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me gratefully\n",
      "We owe you so much, Dr\n",
      "Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself\n",
      "You are looking pale yourself\n",
      "You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit\n",
      "that you do\n",
      "As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head\n",
      "The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me\n",
      "I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips\n",
      "with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows\n",
      "Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough\n",
      "Make yourself strong\n",
      "I stay here tonight, and I shall sit up with little miss myself\n",
      "You and I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know\n",
      "I have grave reasons\n",
      "No, do not ask them\n",
      "think what you will\n",
      "Do not fear to think even the most notprobable\n",
      "In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy\n",
      "They implored me to let them\n",
      "and when I said it was Dr\n",
      "Van Helsings wish that either he or I should sit up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman\n",
      "I was much touched by their kindness\n",
      "Perhaps it is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucys account, that their devotion was manifested\n",
      "for over and over again have I seen similar instances of womans kindness\n",
      "I got back here in time for a late dinner\n",
      "went my rounds\n",
      "and set this down whilst waiting for sleep\n",
      "It is coming\n",
      "This afternoon I went over to Hillingham\n",
      "Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better\n",
      "Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor\n",
      "He opened it with much impressment\n",
      "assumed, of course\n",
      "and showed a great bundle of white flowers\n",
      "These are for you, Miss Lucy, he said\n",
      "Oh, Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing\n",
      "Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with\n",
      "These are medicines\n",
      "Here Lucy made a wry face\n",
      "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort\n",
      "Aha, my pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again\n",
      "This is medicinal, but you do not know how\n",
      "I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well\n",
      "they, like the lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten\n",
      "It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them\n",
      "Now she threw them down, saying, with halflaughter, and halfdisgust\n",
      "Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me\n",
      "Why, these flowers are only common garlic\n",
      "To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting\n",
      "No trifling with me\n",
      "I never jest\n",
      "There is grim purpose in all I do\n",
      "and I warn you that you do not thwart me\n",
      "Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own\n",
      "Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went on more gently Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me\n",
      "I only do for your good\n",
      "but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers\n",
      "See, I place them myself in your room\n",
      "I make myself the wreath that you are to wear\n",
      "no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions\n",
      "We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience\n",
      "and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you\n",
      "Now sit still awhile\n",
      "Come with me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the year\n",
      "I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here\n",
      "We went into the room, taking the flowers with us\n",
      "The Professors actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that I ever heard of\n",
      "First he fastened up the windows and latched them securely\n",
      "next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell\n",
      "Then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way\n",
      "It all seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said\n",
      "Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me\n",
      "It is well we have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit\n",
      "Perhaps I am\n",
      "he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck\n",
      "We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck\n",
      "The last words he said to her were\n",
      "Take care you do not disturb it\n",
      "and even if the room feel close, do not tonight open the window or the door\n",
      "I promise, said Lucy, and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me\n",
      "Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such friends\n",
      "As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said\n",
      "Tonight I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want\n",
      "two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink\n",
      "Tomorrow in the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my spell which I have work\n",
      "ho\n",
      "He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror\n",
      "It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears\n",

      "He rubbed his hands together, and said\n",
      "I thought I had diagnosed the case\n",
      "My treatment is working, to which she answered\n",
      "You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor\n",
      "Lucys state this morning is due in part to me\n",
      "How you do mean, maam\n",
      "asked the Professor\n",
      "Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into her room\n",
      "She was sleeping soundly\n",
      "so soundly that even my coming did not wake her\n",
      "But the room was awfully stuffy\n",
      "There were a lot of those horrible, strongsmelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck\n",
      "I feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air\n",
      "You will be pleased with her, I am sure\n",
      "She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early\n",
      "As she had spoken, I watched the Professors face, and saw it turn ashen grey\n",
      "He had been able to retain his selfcommand whilst the poor lady was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be\n",
      "he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room\n",
      "But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the diningroom and closed the door\n",
      "Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down\n",
      "He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way\n",
      "finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart\n",
      "Then he raised his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe\n",
      "God\n",
      "he said\n",
      "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that we are so sore beset\n",
      "Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way\n",
      "This poor mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul\n",
      "and we must not tell her, we must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die\n",
      "Oh, how we are beset\n",
      "How are all the powers of the devils against us\n",

      "Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed\n",
      "This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful, waxen pallor as before\n",
      "He wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity\n",
      "As I expected, he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much\n",
      "Without a word he went and locked the door, and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood\n",
      "I had long ago recognised the necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a warning hand\n",
      "he said\n",
      "Today you must operate\n",
      "I shall provide\n",
      "You are weakened already\n",

      "again the narcotic\n",
      "again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep\n",
      "This time I watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested\n",
      "Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs\n",
      "Westenra that she must not remove anything from Lucys room without consulting him\n",
      "that the flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure\n",

      "After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words Pall Mall Gazette as a sort of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf department is included\n",
      "Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephanthouse, and was just sitting down to his tea when I found him\n",
      "Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable\n",
      "The keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied\n",
      "Then when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said\n",
      "Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want\n",
      "Youll excoose me refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals\n",
      "I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk them questions\n",
      "How do you mean, ask them questions\n",
      "I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour\n",
      "Ittin of them over the ead with a pole is one way\n",
      "scratchin of their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a showorf to their gals\n",
      "I dont so much mind the fust\n",
      "the ittin with a pole afore I chucks in their dinner\n",
      "but I waits till theyve ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the earscratchin\n",
      "Mind you, he added philosophically, theres a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles\n",
      "Heres you acomin and arskin of me questions about my business, and I that grumpylike that only for your bloomin arfquid Id a seen you blowed fust fore Id answer\n",
      "Not even when you arsked me sarcasticlike if Id like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions\n",
      "Without offence did I tell yer to go to ell\n",
      "An when you said youd report me for usin of obscene language that was ittin me over the ead\n",
      "but the arfquid made that all right\n",
      "I werent agoin to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my owl as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does\n",
      "But, Lor love yer art, now that the old ooman has stuck a chunk of her teacake in me, an rinsed me out with her bloomin old teapot, and Ive lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all youre worth, and wont git even a growl out of me\n",
      "Drive along with your questions\n",
      "I know what yer acomin at, that ere escaped wolf\n",
      "I want you to give me your view of it\n",
      "Just tell me how it happened\n",
      "and when I know the facts Ill get you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end\n",
      "All right, guvnor\n",
      "This ere is about the ole story\n",
      "That ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrachs, which we bought off him four years ago\n",
      "He was a nice wellbehaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of\n",
      "Im more surprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place\n",
      "But, there, you cant trust wolves no more nor women\n",
      "Dont you mind him, sir\n",
      "broke in Mrs\n",
      "Tom, with a cheery laugh\n",
      "Es got mindin the animiles so long that blest if he aint like a old wolf isself\n",
      "But there aint no arm in im\n",
      "Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when I first hear my disturbance\n",
      "I was makin up a litter in the monkeyhouse for a young puma which is ill\n",
      "but when I heard the yelpin and owlin I kem away straight\n",
      "There was Bersicker atearin like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out\n",
      "There wasnt much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin through it\n",
      "He had a ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at\n",
      "He ad white kid gloves on is ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something\n",
      "Maybe its you, says I, for I did not like the airs as he give isself\n",
      "He didnt git angry, as I oped he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth\n",
      "Oh no, they wouldnt like me, e says\n",
      "Ow yes, they would, says I, aimitatin of him\n",
      "They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about teatime, which you as a bagful\n",
      "Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us atalkin they lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever\n",
      "That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didnt put in his hand and stroke the old wolfs ears too\n",
      "Tyke care, says I\n",
      "Bersicker is quick\n",
      "Never mind, he says\n",
      "Im used to em\n",
      "Are you in the business yourself\n",
      "I says, tyking off my at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers\n",
      "No says he, not exactly in the business, but I ave made pets of several\n",
      "And with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord, and walks away\n",
      "Old Bersicker kep alookin arter im till e was out of sight, and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ole hevening\n",
      "Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began aowling\n",
      "There warnt nothing for them to owl at\n",
      "There warnt no one near, except some one that was evidently acallin a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road\n",
      "Once or twice I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the owling stopped\n",
      "Just before twelve oclock I just took a look round afore turnin in, an, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersickers cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty\n",
      "And thats all I know for certing\n",
      "Did any one else see anything\n",
      "One of our gardners was acomin ome about that time from a armony, when he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges\n",
      "At least, so he says, but I dont give much for it myself, for if he did e never said a word about it to his missis when e got ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all nightahuntin of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein anything\n",
      "My own belief was that the armony ad got into his ead\n",
      "Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf\n",
      "Well, sir, he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, I think I can\n",
      "but I dont know as ow youd be satisfied with the theory\n",
      "Certainly I shall\n",
      "If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, cant hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try\n",
      "Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way\n",
      "it seems to me that ere wolf escaped\n",
      "simply because he wanted to get out\n",
      "From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell\n",
      "I couldnt cope in badinage with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said\n",
      "Bilder, well consider that first halfsovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when youve told me what you think will happen\n",
      "Right yare, sir, he said briskly\n",
      "Yell excoose me, I know, for achaffin of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on\n",
      "Well, I never\n",
      "said the old lady\n",
      "My opinion is this that ere wolf is aidin of, somewheres\n",
      "The gardner wot didnt remember said he was agallopin northward faster than a horse could go\n",
      "but I dont believe him, for, yer see, sir, wolves dont gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein built that way\n",
      "Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin somethin thats more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is\n",
      "But, Lor bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or bold as a good dog\n",
      "and not half a quarter so much fight in im\n",
      "This one aint been used to fightin or even to providin for hisself, and more like hes somewhere round the Park aidin an ashiverin of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin where he is to get his breakfast from\n",
      "or maybe hes got down some area and is in a coalcellar\n",
      "My eye, wont some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes ashining at her out of the dark\n",
      "If he cant get food hes bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butchers shop in time\n",
      "If he doesnt, and some nursemaid goes awalkin orf with a soldier, leavin of the hinfant in the perambulator\n",
      "well, then I shouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less\n",
      "I was handing him the halfsovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr\n",
      "Bilders face doubled its natural length with surprise\n",
      "God bless me\n",
      "If there aint old Bersicker come back by isself\n",
      "He went to the door and opened it\n",
      "a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me\n",
      "I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us\n",
      "a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea\n",
      "After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog\n",
      "The animal itself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of all picturewolves\n",
      "Red Riding Hoods quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade\n",
      "The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos\n",
      "The wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son\n",
      "Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said\n",
      "There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble\n",
      "didnt I say it all along\n",
      "Heres his head all cut and full of broken glass\n",
      "Es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other\n",
      "Its a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles\n",
      "This eres what comes of it\n",
      "Come along, Bersicker\n",
      "He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report\n",
      "I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo\n",
      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear\n",
      "Suddenly the door was burst open, and in rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion\n",
      "I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the Superintendents study is almost unknown\n",
      "Without an instants pause he made straight at me\n",
      "He had a dinnerknife in his hand, and, as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us\n",
      "He was too quick and too strong for me, however\n",
      "for before I could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely\n",
      "Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor\n",
      "My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet\n",
      "I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time\n",
      "When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment positively sickened me\n",
      "He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist\n",
      "He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again The blood is the life\n",
      "The blood is the life\n",
      "I cannot afford to lose blood just at present\n",
      "I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucys illness and its horrible phases is telling on me\n",
      "I am overexcited and weary, and I need rest, rest, rest\n",
      "Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep\n",
      "tonight I could not well do without it\n",

      "Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given\n",
      "delivered late by twentytwo hours\n",
      "Do not fail to be at Hillingham tonight\n",
      "If not watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as placed\n",
      "very important\n",
      "do not fail\n",
      "Shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival\n",
      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "Just off for train to London\n",
      "The arrival of Van Helsings telegram filled me with dismay\n",
      "A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night\n",
      "Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what may have happened\n",
      "Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do\n",
      "I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucys phonograph\n",
      "Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra\n",
      "I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me\n",
      "This is an exact record of what took place tonight\n",
      "I feel I am dying of weakness, and have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing\n",
      "I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep\n",
      "I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleepwalking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I know so well\n",
      "I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr\n",
      "Seward was in the next room\n",
      "Van Helsing said he would be\n",
      "so that I might have called him\n",
      "I tried to go to sleep, but could not\n",
      "Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake\n",
      "Perversely sleep would try to come then when I did not want it\n",
      "so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out Is there anybody there\n",
      "There was no answer\n",
      "I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again\n",
      "Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dogs, but more fierce and deeper\n",
      "I went to the window and looked out, but could see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window\n",
      "So I went back to bed again, but determined not to go to sleep\n",
      "Presently the door opened, and mother looked in\n",
      "seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me\n",
      "She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont\n",
      "I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right\n",
      "I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me\n",
      "she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed\n",
      "As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again\n",
      "She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out What is that\n",
      "I tried to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet\n",
      "but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly\n",
      "After a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor\n",
      "The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf\n",
      "Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her\n",
      "Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me\n",
      "For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat\n",
      "then she fell over\n",
      "as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two\n",
      "The room and all round seemed to spin round\n",
      "I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert\n",
      "I tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mothers poor body, which seemed to grow cold already\n",
      "for her dear heart had ceased to beat\n",
      "weighed me down\n",
      "and I remembered no more for a while\n",
      "The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered consciousness again\n",
      "Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling\n",
      "the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling\n",
      "and in our shrubbery, seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing\n",
      "I was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me\n",
      "The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door\n",
      "I called to them, and they came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay over me on the bed, they screamed out\n",
      "The wind rushed in through the broken window, and the door slammed to\n",
      "They lifted off the body of my dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I had got up\n",
      "They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them to go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine\n",
      "The door flew open for an instant and closed again\n",
      "The maids shrieked, and then went in a body to the diningroom\n",
      "and I laid what flowers I had on my dear mothers breast\n",
      "When they were there I remembered what Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing had told me, but I didnt like to remove them, and, besides, I would have some of the servants to sit up with me now\n",
      "I was surprised that the maids did not come back\n",
      "I called them, but got no answer, so I went to the diningroom to look for them\n",
      "My heart sank when I saw what had happened\n",
      "They all four lay helpless on the floor, breathing heavily\n",
      "The decanter of sherry was on the table half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about\n",
      "I was suspicious, and examined the decanter\n",
      "It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the sideboard, I found that the bottle which mothers doctor uses for her\n",
      "did use\n",
      "What am I to do\n",
      "what am I to do\n",
      "I am back in the room with mother\n",
      "I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged\n",
      "Alone with the dead\n",
      "I dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window\n",
      "The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim\n",
      "What am I to do\n",
      "God shield me from harm this night\n",
      "I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out\n",
      "My dear mother gone\n",
      "It is time that I go too\n",
      "Goodbye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night\n",
      "God keep you, dear, and God help me\n",
      "CHAPTER XII  DR\n",
      "SEWARDS DIARY   I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early\n",
      "Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone\n",
      "I knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door\n",
      "After a while, finding no response, I knocked and rang again\n",
      "still no answer\n",
      "I cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour\n",
      "for it was now ten oclock\n",
      "and so rang and knocked again, but more impatiently, but still without response\n",
      "Hitherto I had blamed only the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me\n",
      "Was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us\n",
      "Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too late\n",
      "I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses\n",
      "and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry anywhere\n",
      "I could find no means of ingress\n",
      "Every window and door was fastened and locked, and I returned baffled to the porch\n",
      "As I did so, I heard the rapid pitpat of a swiftly driven horses feet\n",
      "They stopped at the gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue\n",
      "When he saw me, he gasped out\n",
      "Then it was you, and just arrived\n",
      "How is she\n",
      "Are we too late\n",
      "Did you not get my telegram\n",
      "I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here, and that I could not make any one in the house hear me\n",
      "He paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly\n",
      "Then I fear we are too late\n",
      "Gods will be done\n",
      "With his usual recuperative energy, he went on Come\n",
      "If there be no way open to get in, we must make one\n",
      "Time is all in all to us now\n",
      "We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen window\n",
      "The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window\n",
      "I attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them\n",
      "Then with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window\n",
      "I helped the Professor in, and followed him\n",
      "There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms, which were close at hand\n",
      "We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the diningroom, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servantwomen lying on the floor\n",
      "There was no need to think them dead, for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition\n",
      "Van Helsing and I looked at each other, and as we moved away he said We can attend to them later\n",
      "Then we ascended to Lucys room\n",
      "For an instant or two we paused at the door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear\n",
      "With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room\n",
      "How shall I describe what we saw\n",
      "On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her mother\n",
      "The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it\n",
      "By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn\n",
      "The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mothers bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled\n",
      "Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching poor Lucys breast\n",
      "then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me\n",
      "It is not yet too late\n",
      "quick\n",
      "Bring the brandy\n",
      "I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found on the table\n",
      "The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I fancied that the narcotic was wearing off\n",
      "I did not stay to make sure, but returned to Van Helsing\n",
      "He rubbed the brandy, as on another occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands\n",
      "He said to me\n",
      "I can do this, all that can be at the present\n",
      "You go wake those maids\n",
      "Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard\n",
      "Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath\n",
      "This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her\n",
      "She will need be heated before we can do anything more\n",
      "I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women\n",
      "The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep\n",
      "The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner\n",
      "I was stern with them, however, and would not let them talk\n",
      "I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy\n",
      "So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were, and prepared fire and water\n",
      "Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water\n",
      "We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it\n",
      "Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door\n",
      "One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it\n",
      "Then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr\n",
      "I bade her simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now\n",
      "She went away with the message, and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him\n",
      "I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest\n",
      "as he knew\n",
      "that it was a standup fight with death, and in a pause told him so\n",
      "He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear\n",
      "If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon\n",
      "He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour\n",
      "Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect\n",
      "Lucys heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement\n",
      "Van Helsings face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me\n",
      "The first gain is ours\n",
      "Check to the King\n",
      "We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat\n",
      "I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat\n",
      "She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her\n",
      "Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room\n",
      "We must consult as to what is to be done, he said as we descended the stairs\n",
      "In the hall he opened the diningroom door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him\n",
      "The shutters had been opened, but the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes\n",
      "The room was, therefore, dimly dark\n",
      "It was, however, light enough for our purposes\n",
      "Van Helsings sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity\n",
      "He was evidently torturing his mind about something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke\n",
      "What are we to do now\n",
      "Where are we to turn for help\n",
      "We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girls life wont be worth an hours purchase\n",
      "You are exhausted already\n",
      "I am exhausted too\n",
      "I fear to trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit\n",
      "What are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her\n",
      "Whats the matter with me, anyhow\n",
      "The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris\n",
      "Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as I cried out Quincey Morris\n",
      "and rushed towards him with outstretched hands\n",
      "What brought you here\n",
      "I cried as our hands met\n",
      "I guess Art is the cause\n",
      "He handed me a telegram\n",
      "Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious\n",
      "Cannot leave\n",
      "Father still in same condition\n",
      "Send me word how Lucy is\n",
      "Do not delay\n",
      "HOLMWOOD\n",
      "I think I came just in the nick of time\n",
      "You know you have only to tell me what to do\n",
      "Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said\n",
      "A brave mans blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble\n",
      "Youre a man and no mistake\n",
      "Well, the devil may work against us for all hes worth, but God sends us men when we want them\n",
      "Once again we went through that ghastly operation\n",
      "I have not the heart to go through with the details\n",
      "Lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions\n",
      "Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear\n",
      "However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect\n",
      "Her faint became a profound slumber\n",
      "The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting\n",
      "I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast\n",
      "Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now was\n",
      "When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand\n",
      "He had evidently read it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow\n",
      "There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved\n",
      "He handed me the paper saying only It dropped from Lucys breast when we carried her to the bath\n",
      "When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him In Gods name, what does it all mean\n",
      "Was she, or is she, mad\n",
      "or what sort of horrible danger is it\n",
      "I was so bewildered that I did not know what to say more\n",
      "Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying\n",
      "Do not trouble about it now\n",
      "Forget it for the present\n",
      "You shall know and understand it all in good time\n",
      "but it will be later\n",
      "And now what is it that you came to me to say\n",
      "This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself again\n",
      "I came to speak about the certificate of death\n",
      "If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced\n",
      "I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did\n",
      "I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs\n",
      "Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it\n",
      "Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker\n",
      "Good, oh my friend John\n",
      "Well thought of\n",
      "Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that love her\n",
      "One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man\n",
      "Ah yes, I know, friend John\n",
      "I am not blind\n",
      "I love you all the more for it\n",
      "In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs\n",
      "Westenra was dead\n",
      "that Lucy also had been ill, but was now going on better\n",
      "and that Van Helsing and I were with her\n",
      "I told him where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said\n",
      "When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves\n",
      "I nodded in reply and went out\n",
      "I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements\n",
      "When I got back Quincey was waiting for me\n",
      "I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room\n",
      "She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side\n",
      "From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature\n",
      "So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfastroom, where the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms\n",
      "When we were alone, he said to me\n",
      "Jack Seward, I dont want to shove myself in anywhere where Ive no right to be\n",
      "but this is no ordinary case\n",
      "You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her\n",
      "but, although thats all past and gone, I cant help feeling anxious about her all the same\n",
      "What is it thats wrong with her\n",
      "The Dutchman\n",
      "and a fine old fellow he is\n",
      "I can see that\n",
      "said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have another transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted\n",
      "Now I know well that you medical men speak in camera, and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private\n",
      "But this is no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part\n",
      "Is not that so\n",
      "Thats so, I said, and he went on\n",
      "I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did today\n",
      "Is not that so\n",
      "And I guess Art was in it too\n",
      "When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer\n",
      "I have not seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night\n",
      "One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay\n",
      "Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so\n",
      "As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious\n",
      "He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain\n",
      "His very heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him\n",
      "and there was a royal lot of it, too\n",
      "to keep him from breaking down\n",
      "I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret\n",
      "but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase Thats so\n",
      "And how long has this been going on\n",
      "About ten days\n",
      "Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men\n",
      "Man alive, her whole body wouldnt hold it\n",
      "Then, coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce halfwhisper What took it out\n",
      "I shook my head\n",
      "That, I said, is the crux\n",
      "Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits end\n",
      "I cant even hazard a guess\n",
      "There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched\n",
      "But these shall not occur again\n",
      "Here we stay until all be well\n",
      "Quincey held out his hand\n",
      "Count me in, he said\n",
      "You and the Dutchman will tell me what to do, and Ill do it\n",
      "When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucys first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read\n",
      "The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed\n",
      "Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened\n",
      "Then she looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered\n",
      "she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before her pale face\n",
      "We both understood what that meant\n",
      "that she had realised to the full her mothers death\n",
      "so we tried what we could to comfort her\n",
      "Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time\n",
      "We told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her\n",
      "Towards dusk she fell into a doze\n",
      "Here a very odd thing occurred\n",
      "Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two\n",
      "Van Helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her\n",
      "All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her hands\n",
      "finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments\n",
      "Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing\n",
      "All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it\n",
      "The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended\n",
      "Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house\n",
      "When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucys strength\n",
      "She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good\n",
      "At times she slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking\n",
      "Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more haggard, and her breathing was softer\n",
      "her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual\n",
      "when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one\n",
      "In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him\n",
      "Quincey went off to meet him at the station\n",
      "When he arrived it was nearly six oclock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks\n",
      "When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion, and none of us could speak\n",
      "In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened\n",
      "Arthurs presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant\n",
      "she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived\n",
      "He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything\n",
      "It was now nearly one oclock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her\n",
      "I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering this on Lucys phonograph\n",
      "Until six oclock they are to try to rest\n",
      "I fear that tomorrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great\n",
      "the poor child cannot rally\n",
      "God help us all\n",
      "Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra\n",
      "17 September\n",
      "My dearest Lucy,\n",
      "It seems an age since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote\n",
      "You will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news\n",
      "Well, I got my husband back all right\n",
      "when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of gout, Mr\n",
      "He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together\n",
      "After dinner Mr\n",

      "My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity\n",
      "and may every blessing attend you both\n",
      "I know you both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up\n",
      "Now I want you to make your home here with me\n",
      "I have left to me neither chick nor child\n",
      "all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything\n",
      "I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands\n",
      "Our evening was a very, very happy one\n",
      "So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawingroom I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks\n",

      "He is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness\n",
      "even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity\n",
      "However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust\n",
      "And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours\n",
      "When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding\n",

      "tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me\n",
      "Jonathan asks me to send his respectful duty, but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins  Harker\n",
      "and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I send you simply his love instead\n",

      "\n",
      "With regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say\n",
      "He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results\n",
      "This afternoon a carriers cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours\n",
      "the house to which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away\n",
      "The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers\n",
      "I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to the house\n",
      "As he passed the window of Renfields room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to\n",
      "The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to shut up for a foulmouthed beggar, whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it\n",
      "I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice, so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying Lor bless yer, sir, I wouldnt mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse\n",
      "I pity ye and the guvnor for havin to live in the house with a wild beast like that\n",
      "Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him where the gate of the empty house was\n",
      "he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man\n",
      "I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a wellbehaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred\n",
      "I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner\n",
      "I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair\n",
      "It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again\n",
      "This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue\n",
      "I called to the attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief\n",
      "My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes\n",
      "The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise\n",
      "Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the ground\n",
      "If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then\n",
      "The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the buttend of his heavy whip\n",
      "It was a terrible blow\n",
      "but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens\n",
      "You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men\n",
      "At first he was silent in his fighting\n",
      "but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a straitwaistcoat on him, he began to shout Ill frustrate them\n",
      "They shant rob me\n",
      "they shant murder me by inches\n",
      "Ill fight for my Lord and Master\n",
      "and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings\n",
      "It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room\n",
      "One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken\n",
      "However, I set it all right\n",
      "and he is going on well\n",
      "The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us\n",
      "Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman\n",
      "They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him\n",
      "They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment\n",
      "I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent\n",
      "I took their names and addresses, in case they might be needed\n",

      "Hawkins has died very suddenly\n",
      "Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father\n",
      "I never knew either father or mother, so that the dear old mans death is a real blow to me\n",
      "Jonathan is greatly distressed\n",
      "It is not only that he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account\n",
      "He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous\n",
      "He begins to doubt himself\n",
      "I try to cheer him up, and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself\n",
      "But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most\n",
      "Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his\n",
      "a nature which enabled him by our dear, good friends aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years\n",
      "should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me get on with my work\n",
      "I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy\n",
      "We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first\n",
      "It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go\n",
      "Van Helsing was very kind to him\n",
      "Come, my child, he said\n",
      "come with me\n",
      "You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of\n",
      "You must not be alone\n",
      "for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms\n",
      "Come to the drawingroom, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas\n",
      "You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep\n",
      "Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucys face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn\n",
      "She lay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be\n",
      "I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic\n",
      "the whole of the windowsashes reeked with it, and round Lucys neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers\n",
      "Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums\n",
      "Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning\n",
      "In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest\n",
      "I sat down by her, and presently she moved uneasily\n",
      "At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window\n",
      "I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind\n",
      "There was a full moonlight, and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round\n",
      "doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim\n",
      "and every now and again struck the window with its wings\n",
      "When I came back to my seat, I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat\n",
      "I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her\n",
      "Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed\n",
      "She took but a little, and that languidly\n",
      "There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness\n",
      "It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her\n",
      "It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her\n",
      "but that when she waked she clutched them close\n",
      "There was no possibility of making any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times\n",
      "At six oclock Van Helsing came to relieve me\n",
      "Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on\n",
      "When he saw Lucys face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp whisper Draw up the blind\n",
      "I want light\n",
      "Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucys, examined her carefully\n",
      "He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat\n",
      "As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, Mein Gott\n",
      "as it was smothered in his throat\n",
      "I bent over and looked, too, and as I noticed some queer chill came over me\n",
      "The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared\n",
      "For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest\n",
      "Then he turned to me and said calmly\n",
      "She is dying\n",
      "It will not be long now\n",
      "It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep\n",
      "Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last\n",
      "he trusts us, and we have promised him\n",
      "I went to the diningroom and waked him\n",
      "He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear\n",
      "I assured him that Lucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near\n",
      "He covered his face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief\n",
      "I took him by the hand and raised him up\n",
      "Come, I said, my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude it will be best and easiest for her\n",
      "When we came into Lucys room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible\n",
      "He had even brushed Lucys hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples\n",
      "When we came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly\n",
      "Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come\n",
      "He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back\n",
      "No, he whispered, not yet\n",
      "Hold her hand\n",
      "it will comfort her more\n",
      "So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes\n",
      "Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep\n",
      "For a little bit her breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired childs\n",
      "And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night\n",
      "Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever\n",
      "In a sort of sleepwaking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips\n",
      "Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come\n",
      "Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her\n",
      "but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room\n",
      "Not for your life\n",
      "not for your living soul and hers\n",
      "And he stood between them like a lion at bay\n",
      "Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say\n",
      "and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting\n",
      "I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face\n",
      "the sharp teeth champed together\n",
      "Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily\n",
      "Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsings great brown one\n",
      "drawing it to her, she kissed it\n",
      "My true friend, she said, in a faint voice, but with untellable pathos, My true friend, and his\n",
      "Oh, guard him, and give me peace\n",
      "I swear it\n",
      "he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath\n",
      "Then he turned to Arthur, and said to him Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and only once\n",
      "Their eyes met instead of their lips\n",
      "and so they parted\n",
      "Lucys eyes closed\n",
      "and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthurs arm, and drew him away\n",
      "And then Lucys breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased\n",
      "It is all over, said Van Helsing\n",
      "She is dead\n",
      "I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawingroom, where he sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see\n",
      "I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever\n",
      "Some change had come over her body\n",
      "Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines\n",
      "even the lips had lost their deadly pallor\n",
      "It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be\n",
      "We thought her dying whilst she slept,         And sleeping when she died\n",
      "I stood beside Van Helsing, and said\n",
      "Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last\n",
      "It is the end\n",
      "He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity\n",
      "alas\n",
      "It is only the beginning\n",
      "When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered\n",

      "I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted\n",
      "or blessed\n",
      "with something of his own obsequious suavity\n",
      "Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brotherprofessional way, when she had come out from the deathchamber\n",
      "She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir\n",
      "Its quite a privilege to attend on her\n",
      "Its not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment\n",
      "I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away\n",
      "This was possible from the disordered state of things in the household\n",
      "There were no relatives at hand\n",
      "and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his fathers funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden\n",
      "Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc\n",
      "He insisted upon looking over Lucys papers himself\n",
      "I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble\n",
      "He answered me\n",
      "I know\n",
      "You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor\n",
      "But this is not altogether for the law\n",
      "You knew that, when you avoided the coroner\n",
      "I have more than him to avoid\n",
      "There may be papers more\n",
      "such as this\n",
      "As he spoke he took from his pocketbook the memorandum which had been in Lucys breast, and which she had torn in her sleep\n",

      "Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him tonight\n",
      "For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucys old room all night, and I myself search for what may be\n",
      "It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers\n",
      "I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs\n",
      "Westenras solicitor and had written to him\n",
      "All the poor ladys papers were in order\n",
      "explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given\n",
      "I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room, saying\n",
      "Can I help you, friend John\n",
      "I am free, and if I may, my service is to you\n",
      "Have you got what you looked for\n",
      "I asked, to which he replied\n",
      "I did not look for any specific thing\n",
      "I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was\n",
      "only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun\n",
      "But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them\n",
      "I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some\n",
      "When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me\n",
      "And now, friend John, I think we may to bed\n",
      "We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate\n",
      "Tomorrow we shall have much to do, but for the tonight there is no need of us\n",
      "Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy\n",
      "The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente\n",
      "There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be\n",
      "The end of the windingsheet was laid over the face\n",
      "when the Professor bent over and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well\n",
      "All Lucys loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of decays effacing fingers, had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse\n",
      "The Professor looked sternly grave\n",
      "He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes\n",
      "He said to me Remain till I return, and left the room\n",
      "He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed\n",
      "Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth\n",
      "He restored the sheet to its place, and we came away\n",
      "I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to speak\n",
      "Tomorrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of postmortem knives\n",
      "Must we make an autopsy\n",
      "Yes and no\n",
      "I want to operate, but not as you think\n",
      "Let me tell you now, but not a word to another\n",
      "I want to cut off her head and take out her heart\n",
      "you a surgeon, and so shocked\n",
      "You, whom I have seen with no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder\n",
      "Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that you loved her\n",
      "and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help\n",
      "I would like to do it tonight, but for Arthur I must not\n",
      "he will be free after his fathers funeral tomorrow, and he will want to see her\n",
      "Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep\n",
      "We shall unscrew the coffinlid, and shall do our operation and then replace all, so that none know, save we alone\n",
      "But why do it at all\n",
      "The girl is dead\n",
      "Why mutilate her poor body without need\n",
      "And if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing to gain by it\n",
      "no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge\n",
      "Without such it is monstrous\n",
      "For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness\n",
      "Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart\n",
      "and I love you the more because it does so bleed\n",
      "If I could, I would take on myself the burden that you do bear\n",
      "But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things\n",
      "John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause\n",
      "I am but man\n",
      "but I believe in all I do\n",
      "Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came\n",
      "Were you not amazed, nay horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love\n",
      "though she was dying\n",
      "and snatched him away by all my strength\n",
      "And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me\n",
      "And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful\n",
      "Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do\n",
      "You have for many years trust me\n",
      "you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt\n",
      "Believe me yet a little, friend John\n",
      "If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think\n",
      "and that is not perhaps well\n",
      "And if I work\n",
      "as work I shall, no matter trust or no trust\n",
      "without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel, oh\n",
      "so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be\n",
      "He paused a moment and went on solemnly Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us\n",
      "Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to a good end\n",
      "Will you not have faith in me\n",
      "I took his hand, and promised him\n",
      "I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and close the door\n",
      "As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage\n",
      "she had her back towards me, so did not see me\n",
      "and go into the room where Lucy lay\n",
      "The sight touched me\n",
      "Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love\n",
      "Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room\n",
      "He came over to my bedside and said\n",
      "You need not trouble about the knives\n",
      "we shall not do it\n",
      "I asked\n",
      "For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me\n",
      "Because, he said sternly, it is too late\n",
      "or too early\n",
      "Here he held up the little golden crucifix\n",
      "This was stolen in the night\n",
      "How, stolen, I asked in wonder, since you have it now\n",
      "Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living\n",
      "Her punishment will surely come, but not through me\n",
      "she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing, she only stole\n",
      "Now we must wait\n",
      "He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with\n",
      "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came Mr\n",
      "Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand  Lidderdale\n",
      "He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to details\n",
      "During lunch he told us that Mrs\n",
      "Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs in absolute order\n",
      "he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucys fathers which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood\n",
      "When he had told us so much he went on\n",
      "Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance\n",
      "Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes\n",
      "Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept\n",
      "We were right in principle, and ninetynine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment\n",
      "Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes\n",
      "For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no will\n",
      "and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case\n",
      "have been treated at her decease as under intestacy\n",
      "In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world\n",
      "and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger\n",
      "I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced\n",
      "He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part\n",
      "in which he was officially interested\n",
      "of so great a tragedy, was an objectlesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding\n",
      "He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming\n",
      "His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts\n",
      "Arthur was expected at five oclock, so a little before that time we visited the deathchamber\n",
      "It was so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it\n",
      "The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once\n",
      "Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancée quite alone\n",
      "The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved\n",
      "Poor fellow\n",
      "He looked desperately sad and broken\n",
      "even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his muchtried emotions\n",
      "He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father\n",
      "and to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him\n",
      "With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was sweetly courteous\n",
      "but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him\n",
      "The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs\n",
      "I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily\n",
      "You loved her too, old fellow\n",
      "she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you\n",
      "I dont know how to thank you for all you have done for her\n",

      "What shall I do\n",
      "The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for\n",
      "I comforted him as well as I could\n",
      "In such cases men do not need much expression\n",
      "A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a mans heart\n",
      "I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him\n",
      "Come and look at her\n",
      "Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face\n",
      "how beautiful she was\n",
      "Every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness\n",
      "It frightened and amazed me somewhat\n",
      "and as for Arthur, he fell atrembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague\n",
      "At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper\n",
      "Jack, is she really dead\n",
      "I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest\n",
      "for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help\n",
      "that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty\n",
      "that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering\n",
      "It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside\n",
      "I told him that that must be goodbye, as the coffin had to be prepared\n",
      "so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead\n",
      "He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came\n",
      "I left him in the drawingroom, and told Van Helsing that he had said goodbye\n",
      "so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertakers men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin\n",
      "When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthurs question, and he replied\n",
      "I am not surprised\n",
      "Just now I doubted for a moment myself\n",
      "We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things\n",
      "Van Helsing had been silent all dinnertime\n",
      "but when we had lit our cigars he said\n",
      "\n",

      "No, no, not that, for Gods sake\n",
      "not yet at any rate\n",

      "it is only because my loss is so recent\n",

      "I only used that name because I was in doubt\n",
      "I must not call you Mr\n",
      ", and I have grown to love you\n",
      "yes, my dear boy, to love you\n",
      "Arthur held out his hand, and took the old mans warmly\n",
      "Call me what you will, he said\n",
      "I hope I may always have the title of a friend\n",
      "And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear\n",
      "He paused a moment, and went on I know that she understood your goodness even better than I do\n",
      "and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so\n",
      "you remember\n",
      "the Professor nodded\n",
      "you must forgive me\n",
      "He answered with a grave kindness\n",
      "I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand\n",
      "and I take it that you do not\n",
      "that you cannot\n",
      "trust me now, for you do not yet understand\n",
      "And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot\n",
      "and may not\n",
      "and must not yet understand\n",
      "But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through\n",
      "Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect\n",
      "And, indeed, indeed, sir, said Arthur warmly, I shall in all ways trust you\n",
      "I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are Jacks friend, and you were hers\n",
      "You shall do what you like\n",
      "The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said\n",
      "May I ask you something now\n",
      "You know that Mrs\n",
      "Westenra left you all her property\n",
      "No, poor dear\n",

      "I have a motive of which, be sure, she would have approved\n",
      "I have them all here\n",
      "I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch them\n",

      "even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe\n",
      "No word shall be lost\n",
      "and in the good time I shall give them back to you\n",
      "Its a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucys sake\n",
      "Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self\n",
      "Van Helsing, you may do what you will\n",
      "I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved\n",
      "I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes\n",
      "The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly\n",
      "And you are right\n",

      "Van Helsing did not go to bed at all\n",

      "Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school\n",
      "I felt it very improper, for you cant go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit\n",

      "so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him\n",
      "He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl\n",
      "He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him\n",
      "His face was not a good face\n",

      "His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking\n",

      "This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles\n",
      "A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the bloofer lady is supremely funny\n",

      "and even imagine themselves\n",
      "There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat\n",
      "The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own\n",

      "Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask\n",
      "I know that you were with her at Whitby\n",
      "She sometimes kept a diary\n",
      "you need not look surprised, Madam Mina\n",
      "it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you\n",
      "and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleepwalking in which she puts down that you saved her\n",
      "In great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember\n",
      "I can tell you, I think, Dr\n",

      "Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details\n",
      "It is not always so with young ladies\n",
      "No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time\n",

      "you will do me much favour\n",
      "I could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit\n",
      "I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths\n",

      "May I read it\n",
      "If you wish, I answered as demurely as I could\n",

      "I know not the shorthand\n",
      "By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed\n",
      "so I took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him\n",
      "Forgive me, I said I could not help it\n",
      "but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not have time to wait\n",
      "not on my account, but because I know your time must be precious\n",

      "By all means, I said, read it over whilst I order lunch\n",
      "and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat\n",
      "He bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed\n",
      "When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement\n",

      "It opens the gate to me\n",

      "But that you do not, cannot, comprehend\n",
      "Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman\n",

      "I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you\n",
      "Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read\n",

      "tell me of him\n",
      "Is he quite well\n",
      "Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and hearty\n",

      "What kind of a shock was it\n",

      "The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult\n",
      "I suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my husband well again\n",
      "He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me\n",
      "he held my hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness\n",
      "My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships\n",
      "but since I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I feel more than ever\n",

      "Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh\n",
      "I have learned not to think little of any ones belief, no matter how strange it be\n",
      "I have tried to keep an open mind\n",
      "and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane\n",

      "I dare not say anything of it\n",

      "how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then\n",
      "and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was\n",
      "Good God, Professor\n",
      "I said, starting up\n",

      "and that such a thing is here in London in the nineteenth century\n",

      "Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men\n",
      "why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties\n",
      "and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint\n",

      "that there are men and women who cannot die\n",
      "We all know\n",
      "because science has vouched for the fact\n",

      "Here I interrupted him\n",
      "I was getting bewildered\n",
      "he so crowded on my mind his list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired\n",
      "I had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam\n",
      "but he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of thought in mind all the time\n",

      "To believe in things that you cannot\n",
      "Let me illustrate\n",
      "I heard once of an American who so defined faith that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue\n",
      "For one, I follow that man\n",
      "He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway truck\n",
      "We get the small truth first\n",
      "We keep him, and we value him\n",
      "but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe\n",
      "Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter\n",
      "Do I read your lesson aright\n",
      "Ah, you are my favourite pupil still\n",
      "It is worth to teach you\n",
      "Now that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to understand\n",
      "You think then that those so small holes in the childrens throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy\n",
      "I suppose so\n",
      "He stood up and said solemnly\n",
      "Then you are wrong\n",
      "Oh, would it were so\n",
      "no\n",
      "It is worse, far, far worse\n",

      "SEWARDS DIARY\n",
      "For a while sheer anger mastered me\n",
      "it was as if he had during her life struck Lucy on the face\n",
      "I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to him\n",
      "Van Helsing, are you mad\n",
      "He raised his head and looked at me, and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once\n",
      "Would I were\n",
      "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this\n",
      "Oh, my friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell you so simple a thing\n",
      "Was it because I hate you and have hated you all my life\n",
      "Was it because I wished to give you pain\n",
      "Was it that I wanted, now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a fearful death\n",
      "Forgive me, said I\n",
      "He went on\n",
      "My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you, for I know you have loved that so sweet lady\n",
      "But even yet I do not expect you to believe\n",
      "It is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the no of it\n",
      "it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy\n",
      "Tonight I go to prove it\n",
      "Dare you come with me\n",
      "This staggered me\n",
      "A man does not like to prove such a truth\n",

      "at worst it will not harm\n",
      "If it be true\n",
      "Ah, there is the dread\n",
      "yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief\n",
      "Come, I tell you what I propose first, that we go off now and see that child in the hospital\n",
      "Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam\n",
      "He will let two scientists see his case, if he will not let two friends\n",
      "We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn\n",
      "\n",
      "He took a key from his pocket and held it up\n",
      "And then we spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies\n",
      "This is the key that lock the tomb\n",
      "I had it from the coffinman to give to Arthur\n",
      "My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us\n",
      "I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing\n",
      "\n",
      "We found the child awake\n",
      "It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well\n",
      "Vincent took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures\n",
      "There was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on Lucys throat\n",
      "They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher\n",
      "that was all\n",
      "We asked Vincent to what he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat\n",
      "but, for his own part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London\n",
      "Out of so many harmless ones, he said, there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species\n",
      "Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape\n",
      "or even from the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire\n",
      "These things do occur, you know\n",
      "Only ten days ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction\n",
      "For a week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare came along, since when it has been quite a galatime with them\n",
      "Even this poor little mite, when he woke up today, asked the nurse if he might go away\n",
      "When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the bloofer lady\n",
      "I hope, said Van Helsing, that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it\n",
      "These fancies to stray are most dangerous\n",
      "and if the child were to remain out another night, it would probably be fatal\n",
      "But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days\n",
      "Certainly not, not for a week at least\n",
      "longer if the wound is not healed\n",
      "Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out\n",
      "When Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said\n",
      "There is no hurry\n",
      "It is more late than I thought\n",
      "Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way\n",
      "We dined at Jack Straws Castle along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy\n",
      "About ten oclock we started from the inn\n",
      "It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius\n",
      "The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly\n",
      "but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to locality\n",
      "As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round\n",
      "At last we reached the wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over\n",
      "With some little difficulty\n",
      "for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us\n",
      "we found the Westenra tomb\n",
      "The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him\n",
      "There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion\n",
      "My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one\n",
      "In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight\n",
      "Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle, proceeded to make a light\n",
      "The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough\n",
      "but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns\n",
      "when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance\n",
      "when timediscoloured stone, and dustencrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded silverplating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined\n",
      "It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life\n",
      "animal life\n",
      "was not the only thing which could pass away\n",
      "Van Helsing went about his work systematically\n",
      "Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucys coffin\n",
      "Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew\n",
      "What are you going to do\n",
      "To open the coffin\n",
      "You shall yet be convinced\n",
      "Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath\n",
      "The sight was almost too much for me\n",
      "It seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living\n",
      "I actually took hold of his hand to stop him\n",
      "He only said You shall see, and again fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fretsaw\n",
      "Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw\n",
      "I had expected a rush of gas from the weekold corpse\n",
      "We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door\n",
      "But the Professor never stopped for a moment\n",
      "he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side\n",
      "Taking the edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look\n",
      "I drew near and looked\n",
      "The coffin was empty\n",
      "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved\n",
      "He was now more sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task\n",
      "Are you satisfied now, friend John\n",
      "I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him\n",
      "I am satisfied that Lucys body is not in that coffin\n",
      "but that only proves one thing\n",
      "And what is that, friend John\n",
      "That it is not there\n",
      "That is good logic, he said, so far as it goes\n",
      "But how do you\n",
      "how can you\n",
      "account for it not being there\n",
      "Perhaps a bodysnatcher, I suggested\n",
      "Some of the undertakers people may have stolen it\n",
      "I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest\n",
      "The Professor sighed\n",
      "he said, we must have more proof\n",
      "Come with me\n",
      "He put on the coffinlid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the bag\n",
      "We opened the door, and went out\n",
      "Behind us he closed the door and locked it\n",
      "He handed me the key, saying Will you keep it\n",
      "You had better be assured\n",
      "it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say\n",
      "as I motioned him to keep it\n",
      "A key is nothing, I said\n",
      "there may be duplicates\n",
      "and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind\n",
      "He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket\n",
      "Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other\n",
      "I took up my place behind a yewtree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight\n",
      "It was a lonely vigil\n",
      "Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two\n",
      "I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming\n",
      "I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had a dreary, miserable time\n",
      "Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yewtrees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb\n",
      "at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professors side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it\n",
      "Then I too moved\n",
      "but I had to go round headstones and railedoff tombs, and I stumbled over graves\n",
      "The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew\n",
      "A little way off, beyond a line of scattered junipertrees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb\n",
      "The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared\n",
      "I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child\n",
      "When he saw me he held it out to me, and said\n",
      "Are you satisfied now\n",
      "No, I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive\n",
      "Do you not see the child\n",
      "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here\n",
      "And is it wounded\n",
      "We shall see, said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child\n",
      "When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the childs throat\n",
      "It was without a scratch or scar of any kind\n",
      "Was I right\n",
      "I asked triumphantly\n",
      "We were just in time, said the Professor thankfully\n",
      "We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it\n",
      "If we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movements during the night\n",
      "at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child\n",
      "So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it\n",
      "we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could\n",
      "All fell out well\n",
      "At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policemans heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro\n",
      "We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away silently\n",
      "By good chance we got a cab near the Spaniards, and drove to town\n",
      "I cannot sleep, so I make this entry\n",
      "But I must try to get a few hours sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon\n",
      "He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition\n",
      "It was two oclock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt\n",
      "The funeral held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of aldertrees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him\n",
      "We knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it\n",
      "but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most\n",
      "Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place\n",
      "and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work\n",
      "Besides, I felt it was all so useless\n",
      "Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight, that the coffin was empty\n",
      "I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated\n",
      "He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously motioned me to precede\n",
      "The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably meanlooking when the sunshine streamed in\n",
      "Van Helsing walked over to Lucys coffin, and I followed\n",
      "He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange\n",
      "and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me\n",
      "There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral\n",
      "She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever\n",
      "and I could not believe that she was dead\n",
      "The lips were red, nay redder than before\n",
      "and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom\n",
      "Is this a juggle\n",
      "I said to him\n",
      "Are you convinced now\n",
      "said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth\n",
      "See, he went on, see, they are even sharper than before\n",
      "With this and this\n",
      "and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it\n",
      "the little children can be bitten\n",
      "Are you of belief now, friend John\n",
      "Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me\n",
      "I could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested\n",
      "so, with an attempt to argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said\n",
      "She may have been placed here since last night\n",
      "That is so, and by whom\n",
      "I do not know\n",
      "Some one has done it\n",
      "And yet she has been dead one week\n",
      "Most peoples in that time would not look so\n",
      "I had no answer for this, so was silent\n",
      "Van Helsing did not seem to notice my silence\n",
      "at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor triumph\n",
      "He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth\n",
      "Then he turned to me and said\n",
      "Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded\n",
      "here is some dual life that is not as the common\n",
      "She was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance, sleepwalking\n",
      "oh, you start\n",
      "you do not know that, friend John, but you shall know it all later\n",
      "and in trance could he best come to take more blood\n",
      "In trance she died, and in trance she is UnDead, too\n",
      "So it is that she differ from all other\n",
      "Usually when the UnDead sleep at home\n",
      "as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was home\n",
      "their face show what they are, but this so sweet that was when she not UnDead she go back to the nothings of the common dead\n",
      "There is no malign there, see, and so it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep\n",
      "This turned my blood cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsings theories\n",
      "but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the idea of killing her\n",
      "He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in my face, for he said almost joyously\n",
      "Ah, you believe now\n",
      "I answered Do not press me too hard all at once\n",
      "I am willing to accept\n",
      "How will you do this bloody work\n",
      "I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall drive a stake through her body\n",
      "It made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved\n",
      "And yet the feeling was not so strong as I had expected\n",
      "I was, in fact, beginning to shudder at the presence of this being, this UnDead, as Van Helsing called it, and to loathe it\n",
      "Is it possible that love is all subjective, or all objective\n",
      "I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as if wrapped in thought\n",
      "Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap, and said\n",
      "I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best\n",
      "If I did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is to be done\n",
      "but there are other things to follow, and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know\n",
      "This is simple\n",
      "She have yet no life taken, though that is of time\n",
      "and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever\n",
      "But then we may have to want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this\n",
      "If you, who saw the wounds on Lucys throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the childs at the hospital\n",
      "if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die\n",
      "if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe\n",
      "He doubted me when I took him from her kiss when she was dying\n",
      "I know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought\n",
      "and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive\n",
      "and that in most mistake of all we have killed her\n",
      "He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that have killed her by our ideas\n",
      "and so he will be much unhappy always\n",
      "Yet he never can be sure\n",
      "and that is the worst of all\n",
      "And he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered\n",
      "and again, he will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all, an UnDead\n",
      "I told him once, and since then I learn much\n",
      "Now, since I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet\n",
      "He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him\n",
      "then we can act for good all round and send him peace\n",
      "My mind is made up\n",
      "You return home for tonight to your asylum, and see that all be well\n",
      "As for me, I shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way\n",
      "Tomorrow night you will come to me to the Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock\n",
      "I shall send for Arthur to come too, and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood\n",
      "Later we shall all have work to do\n",
      "I come with you so far as Piccadilly and there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set\n",
      "So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly\n",
      "Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to John Seward, M\n",

      "It pleases me that the UnDead, Miss Lucy, shall not leave tonight, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager\n",
      "Therefore I shall fix some things she like not\n",
      "garlic and a crucifix\n",
      "and so seal up the door of the tomb\n",
      "She is young as UnDead, and will heed\n",
      "Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out\n",
      "they may not prevail on her wanting to get in\n",
      "for then the UnDead is desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may be\n",
      "I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it\n",
      "For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear\n",
      "but that other to whom is there that she is UnDead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter\n",
      "He is cunning, as I know from Mr\n",
      "Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucys life, and we lost\n",
      "and in many ways the UnDead are strong\n",
      "He have always the strength in his hand of twenty men\n",
      "even we four who gave our strength to Miss Lucy it also is all to him\n",
      "Besides, he can summon his wolf and I know not what\n",
      "So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me\n",
      "but none other shall\n",
      "until it be too late\n",

      "There is no reason why he should\n",

      "Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things\n",

      "he told us all that he wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all our wills were centred in his\n",
      "He began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too, for, he said, there is a grave duty to be done there\n",
      "You were doubtless surprised at my letter\n",
      "This query was directly addressed to Lord Godalming\n",
      "It rather upset me for a bit\n",
      "There has been so much trouble around my house of late that I could do without any more\n",
      "I have been curious, too, as to what you mean\n",
      "Quincey and I talked it over\n",
      "but the more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself that Im about up a tree as to any meaning about anything\n",
      "Me too, said Quincey Morris laconically\n",
      "Oh, said the Professor, then you are nearer the beginning, both of you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin\n",
      "It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word\n",
      "Then, turning to the other two, he said with intense gravity\n",
      "I want your permission to do what I think good this night\n",
      "It is, I know, much to ask\n",
      "and when you know what it is I propose to do you will know, and only then, how much\n",
      "Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time\n",
      "I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be\n",
      "you shall not blame yourselves for anything\n",

      "I dont quite see his drift, but I swear hes honest\n",
      "and thats good enough for me\n",
      "I thank you, sir, said Van Helsing proudly\n",
      "I have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear to me\n",
      "He held out a hand, which Quincey took\n",
      "Then Arthur spoke out\n",
      "Van Helsing, I dont quite like to buy a pig in a poke, as they say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise\n",
      "If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two, then I give my consent at once\n",
      "though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at\n",
      "I accept your limitation, said Van Helsing, and all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations\n",
      "said Arthur\n",
      "that is only fair\n",
      "And now that the pourparlers are over, may I ask what it is we are to do\n",
      "I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at Kingstead\n",

      "And when in the tomb\n",
      "To open the coffin\n",
      "This is too much\n",

      "of one who\n",

      "Take care, sir, take care\n",
      "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say\n",

      "There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they may solve only in part\n",

      "Not for the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body\n",
      "Van Helsing, you try me too far\n",
      "What have I done to you that you should torture me so\n",
      "What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave\n",
      "Are you mad that speak such things, or am I mad to listen to them\n",
      "Dont dare to think more of such a desecration\n",

      "and, by God, I shall do it\n",

      "and if when later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then\n",
      "then I shall do my duty, whatever it may seem to me\n",
      "And then, to follow of your Lordships wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where you will\n",
      "His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of pity\n",
      "But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me\n",
      "In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now\n",
      "Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow\n",

      "For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow\n",
      "I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good\n",
      "at the first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love\n",
      "I am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness\n",
      "I gave what you gave\n",
      "the blood of my veins\n",
      "I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend\n",
      "I gave to her my nights and days\n",
      "before death, after death\n",
      "and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead UnDead, she shall have it freely\n",
      "He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it\n",
      "He took the old mans hand and said in a broken voice\n",
      "Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand\n",
      "but at least I shall go with you and wait\n",
      "CHAPTER XVI  DR\n",
      "SEWARDS DIARY\n",
      "continued   It was just a quarter before twelve oclock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall\n",
      "The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky\n",
      "We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way\n",
      "When we had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him\n",
      "but he bore himself well\n",
      "I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief\n",
      "The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself\n",
      "The rest of us followed, and he closed the door\n",
      "He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin\n",
      "Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly\n",
      "Van Helsing said to me\n",
      "You were with me here yesterday\n",
      "Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin\n",
      "The Professor turned to the rest saying\n",
      "and yet there is no one who does not believe with me\n",
      "He took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin\n",
      "Arthur looked on, very pale but silent\n",
      "when the lid was removed he stepped forward\n",
      "He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it\n",
      "When he saw the rent in the lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness\n",
      "he was still silent\n",
      "Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled\n",
      "The coffin was empty\n",
      "For several minutes no one spoke a word\n",
      "The silence was broken by Quincey Morris\n",
      "Professor, I answered for you\n",
      "Your word is all I want\n",
      "I wouldnt ask such a thing ordinarily\n",
      "I wouldnt so dishonour you as to imply a doubt\n",
      "but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour\n",
      "Is this your doing\n",
      "I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor touched her\n",
      "What happened was this Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here\n",
      "with good purpose, believe me\n",
      "I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty\n",
      "We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees\n",
      "The next day we came here in daytime, and she lay there\n",
      "Did she not, friend John\n",
      "That night we were just in time\n",
      "One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves\n",
      "Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can move\n",
      "I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing\n",
      "It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the UnDead cannot bear, and other things which they shun\n",
      "Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things\n",
      "And so it is we find this coffin empty\n",
      "But bear with me\n",
      "So far there is much that is strange\n",
      "Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be\n",
      "here he shut the dark slide of his lantern\n",
      "now to the outside\n",
      "He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him\n",
      "but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault\n",
      "How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing\n",
      "like the gladness and sorrow of a mans life\n",
      "how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay\n",
      "how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city\n",
      "Each in his own way was solemn and overcome\n",
      "Arthur was silent, and was, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery\n",
      "I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsings conclusions\n",
      "Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake\n",
      "Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a goodsized plug of tobacco and began to chew\n",
      "As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way\n",
      "First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, waferlike biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin\n",
      "next he took out a doublehandful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty\n",
      "He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands\n",
      "This he then took, and rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb\n",
      "I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was doing\n",
      "Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious\n",
      "He answered\n",
      "I am closing the tomb, so that the UnDead may not enter\n",
      "And is that stuff you have put there going to do it\n",
      "asked Quincey\n",
      "Great Scott\n",
      "Is this a game\n",
      "What is that which you are using\n",
      "This time the question was by Arthur\n",
      "Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered\n",
      "I brought it from Amsterdam\n",
      "I have an Indulgence\n",
      "It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professors, a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust\n",
      "In respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching\n",
      "I pitied the others, especially Arthur\n",
      "I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror\n",
      "and yet I, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me\n",
      "Never did tombs look so ghastly white\n",
      "never did cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom\n",
      "never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously\n",
      "never did bough creak so mysteriously\n",
      "and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night\n",
      "There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen Ssss\n",
      "He pointed\n",
      "and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance\n",
      "a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast\n",
      "The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a darkhaired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave\n",
      "We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fairhaired child\n",
      "There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams\n",
      "We were starting forward, but the Professors warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yewtree, kept us back\n",
      "and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again\n",
      "It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held\n",
      "My own heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra\n",
      "Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed\n",
      "The sweetness was turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness\n",
      "Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we all advanced too\n",
      "the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb\n",
      "Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide\n",
      "by the concentrated light that fell on Lucys face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn deathrobe\n",
      "We shuddered with horror\n",
      "I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsings iron nerve had failed\n",
      "Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen\n",
      "I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape\n",
      "saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares\n",
      "then her eyes ranged over us\n",
      "Lucys eyes in form and colour\n",
      "but Lucys eyes unclean and full of hellfire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew\n",
      "At that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing\n",
      "had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage delight\n",
      "As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile\n",
      "Oh, God, how it made me shudder to see it\n",
      "With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone\n",
      "The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning\n",
      "There was a coldbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur\n",
      "when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands\n",
      "She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said\n",
      "Come to me, Arthur\n",
      "Leave these others and come to me\n",
      "My arms are hungry for you\n",
      "Come, and we can rest together\n",
      "Come, my husband, come\n",
      "There was something diabolically sweet in her tones\n",
      "something of the tingling of glass when struck\n",
      "which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another\n",
      "As for Arthur, he seemed under a spell\n",
      "moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms\n",
      "She was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix\n",
      "She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb\n",
      "When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force\n",
      "Then she turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van Helsings iron nerves\n",
      "Never did I see such baffled malice on a face\n",
      "and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes\n",
      "The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusas snakes, and the lovely, bloodstained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese\n",
      "If ever a face meant death\n",
      "if looks could kill\n",
      "we saw it at that moment\n",
      "And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry\n",
      "Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur\n",
      "Answer me, oh my friend\n",
      "Am I to proceed in my work\n",
      "Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered\n",
      "Do as you will, friend\n",
      "do as you will\n",
      "There can be no horror like this ever any more\n",
      "and he groaned in spirit\n",
      "Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms\n",
      "We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down\n",
      "coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there\n",
      "We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knifeblade could have gone\n",
      "We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door\n",
      "When this was done, he lifted the child and said  Come now, my friends\n",
      "we can do no more till tomorrow\n",
      "There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that\n",
      "The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain\n",
      "Then there is more to do\n",
      "but not like this of tonight\n",
      "As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by tomorrow night he shall be well\n",
      "We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night\n",
      "and then to home\n",
      "Coming close to Arthur, he said\n",
      "My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial\n",
      "but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary\n",
      "You are now in the bitter waters, my child\n",
      "By this time tomorrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters\n",
      "so do not mourn overmuch\n",
      "Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me\n",
      "Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way\n",
      "We had left the child in safety, and were tired\n",
      "so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep\n",
      "Arthur, Quincey Morris, and myself\n",
      "called for the Professor\n",
      "It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes\n",
      "Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct\n",
      "We got to the churchyard by halfpast one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to ourselves\n",
      "Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag\n",
      "it was manifestly of fair weight\n",
      "When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the Professor to the tomb\n",
      "He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us\n",
      "Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by\n",
      "When he again lifted the lid off Lucys coffin we all looked\n",
      "Arthur trembling like an aspen\n",
      "and saw that the body lay there in all its deathbeauty\n",
      "But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucys shape without her soul\n",
      "I could see even Arthurs face grow hard as he looked\n",
      "Presently he said to Van Helsing\n",
      "Is this really Lucys body, or only a demon in her shape\n",
      "It is her body, and yet not it\n",
      "But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is\n",
      "She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there\n",
      "the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth\n",
      "which it made one shudder to see\n",
      "the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a devilish mockery of Lucys sweet purity\n",
      "Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use\n",
      "First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oillamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame\n",
      "then his operating knives, which he placed to hand\n",
      "and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long\n",
      "One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point\n",
      "With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coalcellar for breaking the lumps\n",
      "To me, a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation\n",
      "They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet\n",
      "When all was ready, Van Helsing said\n",
      "Before we do anything, let me tell you this\n",
      "it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the UnDead\n",
      "When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of immortality\n",
      "they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world\n",
      "for all that die from the preying of the UnDead becomes themselves UnDead, and prey on their kind\n",
      "And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water\n",
      "Friend Arthur, if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die\n",
      "or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died, have become nosferatu, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make more of those UnDeads that so have fill us with horror\n",
      "The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun\n",
      "Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse\n",
      "but if she live on, UnDead, more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her\n",
      "and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth\n",
      "But if she die in truth, then all cease\n",
      "the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been\n",
      "But of the most blessed of all, when this now UnDead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free\n",
      "Instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels\n",
      "So that, my friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free\n",
      "To this I am willing\n",
      "but is there none amongst us who has a better right\n",
      "Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not It was my hand that sent her to the stars\n",
      "it was the hand of him that loved her best\n",
      "the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose\n",
      "Tell me if there be such a one amongst us\n",
      "We all looked at Arthur\n",
      "He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory\n",
      "he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow\n",
      "My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you\n",
      "Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not falter\n",
      "Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said\n",
      "A moments courage, and it is done\n",
      "This stake must be driven through her\n",
      "It will be a fearful ordeal\n",
      "be not deceived in that\n",
      "but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great\n",
      "from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air\n",
      "But you must not falter when once you have begun\n",
      "Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the time\n",
      "Go on, said Arthur hoarsely\n",
      "Tell me what I am to do\n",
      "Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the heart, and the hammer in your right\n",
      "Then when we begin our prayer for the dead\n",
      "I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall follow\n",
      "strike in Gods name, that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the UnDead pass away\n",
      "Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered\n",
      "Van Helsing opened his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we could\n",
      "Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh\n",
      "Then he struck with all his might\n",
      "The Thing in the coffin writhed\n",
      "and a hideous, bloodcurdling screech came from the opened red lips\n",
      "The body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions\n",
      "the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam\n",
      "But Arthur never faltered\n",
      "He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercybearing stake, whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it\n",
      "His face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it\n",
      "the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault\n",
      "And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver\n",
      "Finally it lay still\n",
      "The terrible task was over\n",
      "The hammer fell from Arthurs hand\n",
      "He reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him\n",
      "The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps\n",
      "It had indeed been an awful strain on him\n",
      "and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it\n",
      "For a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin\n",
      "When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us\n",
      "We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had been seated on the ground, and came and looked too\n",
      "and then a glad, strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it\n",
      "There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity\n",
      "True that there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and pain and waste\n",
      "but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth to what we knew\n",
      "One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever\n",
      "Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthurs shoulder, and said to him\n",
      "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven\n",
      "The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old mans hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said\n",
      "God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again, and me peace\n",
      "He put his hands on the Professors shoulder, and laying his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood unmoving\n",
      "When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him\n",

      "It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I bent over and kissed him\n",
      "The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat\n",

      "but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place\n",
      "His method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him\n",
      "It was quite evident that he feared, or was jealous of, some interference\n",
      "When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully Let the lady come in, and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered\n",
      "For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent\n",
      "I remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her\n",
      "She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic\n",

      "This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt\n",

      "How did you know I wanted to marry any one\n",
      "His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs\n",
      "Harker to me, instantly turning them back again\n",
      "What an asinine question\n",
      "I dont see that at all, Mr\n",
      "Renfield, said Mrs\n",
      "Harker, at once championing me\n",
      "He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me\n",
      "You will, of course, understand, Mrs\n",
      "Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of interest in our little community\n",
      "Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects\n",
      "Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi\n",
      "I positively opened my eyes at this new development\n",
      "Here was my own pet lunatic\n",
      "the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with\n",
      "talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman\n",
      "I wonder if it was Mrs\n",
      "Harkers presence which had touched some chord in his memory\n",
      "If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power\n",

      "and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic\n",
      "I was again astonished, for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity\n",
      "he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things\n",
      "Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief\n",
      "Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control\n",
      "I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong life\n",
      "At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life\n",
      "The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood\n",
      "relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, For the blood is the life\n",
      "Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt\n",
      "Isnt that true, doctor\n",
      "I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to either think or say\n",
      "it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before\n",

      "he is devil in callous, and the heart of him is not\n",
      "he can, within limitations, appear at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him\n",
      "he can, within his range, direct the elements\n",

      "he can command all the meaner things the rat, and the owl, and the bat\n",
      "the moth, and the fox, and the wolf\n",
      "he can grow and become small\n",
      "and he can at times vanish and come unknown\n",

      "How shall we find his where\n",
      "and having found it, how can we destroy\n",
      "My friends, this is much\n",
      "it is a terrible task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder\n",
      "For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win\n",
      "and then where end we\n",
      "Life is nothings\n",
      "I heed him not\n",
      "But to fail here, is not mere life or death\n",
      "It is that we become as him\n",
      "that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him\n",
      "without heart or conscience, preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best\n",
      "To us for ever are the gates of heaven shut\n",
      "for who shall open them to us again\n",
      "We go on for all time abhorred by all\n",
      "a blot on the face of Gods sunshine\n",
      "an arrow in the side of Him who died for man\n",
      "But we are face to face with duty\n",
      "and in such case must we shrink\n",
      "For me, I say, no\n",
      "but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind\n",
      "You others are young\n",
      "Some have seen sorrow\n",
      "but there are fair days yet in store\n",
      "What say you\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand\n",
      "I feared, oh so much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I saw his hand stretch out\n",
      "but it was life to me to feel its touch\n",
      "so strong, so selfreliant, so resolute\n",
      "A brave mans hand can speak for itself\n",
      "it does not even need a womans love to hear its music\n",
      "When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I in his\n",
      "there was no need for speaking between us\n",
      "I answer for Mina and myself, he said\n",
      "Count me in, Professor, said Mr\n",

      "I am with you, said Lord Godalming, for Lucys sake, if for no other reason\n",
      "Seward simply nodded\n",
      "The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side\n",
      "I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left\n",
      "Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr\n",
      "So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made\n",
      "I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even occur to me to draw back\n",
      "We resumed our places, and Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun\n",
      "It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way, as any other transaction of life\n",
      "Well, you know what we have to contend against\n",
      "but we, too, are not without strength\n",
      "We have on our side power of combination\n",
      "a power denied to the vampire kind\n",
      "we have sources of science\n",
      "we are free to act and think\n",
      "and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally\n",
      "In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are free to use them\n",
      "We have selfdevotion in a cause, and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one\n",
      "These things are much\n",
      "Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict, and how the individual cannot\n",
      "In fine, let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular\n",
      "All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions\n",
      "These do not at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death\n",
      "nay of more than either life or death\n",
      "Yet must we be satisfied\n",
      "in the first place because we have to be\n",
      "no other means is at our control\n",
      "and secondly, because, after all, these things\n",
      "tradition and superstition\n",
      "are everything\n",
      "Does not the belief in vampires rest for others\n",
      "though not, alas\n",
      "on them\n",
      "A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matteroffact nineteenth century\n",
      "We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes\n",
      "Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base\n",
      "For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been\n",
      "In old Greece, in old Rome\n",
      "he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese\n",
      "and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day\n",
      "He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the devilbegotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar\n",
      "So far, then, we have all we may act upon\n",
      "and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience\n",
      "The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time\n",
      "he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living\n",
      "Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger\n",
      "that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty\n",
      "But he cannot flourish without this diet\n",
      "he eat not as others\n",
      "Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never\n",
      "He throws no shadow\n",
      "he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe\n",
      "He has the strength of many of his hand\n",
      "witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too\n",
      "He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog\n",
      "he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy\n",
      "He can come in mist which he create\n",
      "that noble ships captain proved him of this\n",
      "but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself\n",
      "He come on moonlight rays as elemental dust\n",
      "as again Jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of Dracula\n",
      "He become so small\n",
      "we ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door\n",
      "He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire\n",
      "solder you call it\n",
      "He can see in the dark\n",
      "no small power this, in a world which is one half shut from the light\n",
      "Ah, but hear me through\n",
      "He can do all these things, yet he is not free\n",
      "he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell\n",
      "He cannot go where he lists\n",
      "he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of natures laws\n",
      "why we know not\n",
      "He may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come\n",
      "though afterwards he can come as he please\n",
      "His power ceases, as does that of all evil things, at the coming of the day\n",
      "Only at certain times can he have limited freedom\n",
      "If he be not at the place whither he is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset\n",
      "These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by inference\n",
      "Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he have his earthhome, his coffinhome, his hellhome, the place unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at Whitby\n",
      "still at other time he can only change when the time come\n",
      "It is said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide\n",
      "Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power, as the garlic that we know of\n",
      "and as for things sacred, as this symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect\n",
      "There are others, too, which I shall tell you of, lest in our seeking we may need them\n",
      "The branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it\n",
      "a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead\n",
      "and as for the stake through him, we know already of its peace\n",
      "or the cutoff head that giveth rest\n",
      "We have seen it with our eyes\n",
      "Thus when we find the habitation of this manthatwas, we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know\n",
      "But he is clever\n",
      "I have asked my friend Arminius, of BudaPesth University, to make his record\n",
      "and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he has been\n",
      "He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of Turkeyland\n",
      "If it be so, then was he no common man\n",
      "for in that time, and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest\n",
      "That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave, and are even now arrayed against us\n",
      "The Draculas were, says Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One\n",
      "They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due\n",
      "In the records are such words as stregoica\n",
      "witch, ordog, and pokol\n",
      "Satan and hell\n",
      "and in one manuscript this very Dracula is spoken of as wampyr, which we all understand too well\n",
      "There have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell\n",
      "For it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good\n",
      "in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest\n",
      "Whilst they were talking Mr\n",
      "Morris was looking steadily at the window, and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room\n",
      "There was a little pause, and then the Professor went on\n",
      "And now we must settle what we do\n",
      "We have here much data, and we must proceed to lay out our campaign\n",
      "We know from the inquiry of Jonathan that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which were delivered at Carfax\n",
      "we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed\n",
      "It seems to me, that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today\n",
      "or whether any more have been removed\n",
      "If the latter, we must trace\n",
      "Here we were interrupted in a very startling way\n",
      "Outside the house came the sound of a pistolshot\n",
      "the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the far wall of the room\n",
      "I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked out\n",
      "The men all jumped to their feet\n",
      "Lord Godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash\n",
      "As he did so we heard Mr\n",
      "Morriss voice without\n",
      "I fear I have alarmed you\n",
      "I shall come in and tell you about it\n",
      "A minute later he came in and said\n",
      "It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs\n",
      "Harker, most sincerely\n",
      "I fear I must have frightened you terribly\n",
      "But the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the windowsill\n",
      "I have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have seen one\n",
      "You used to laugh at me for it then, Art\n",
      "Did you hit it\n",
      "Van Helsing\n",
      "I dont know\n",
      "I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood\n",
      "Without saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his statement\n",
      "We must trace each of these boxes\n",
      "and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair\n",
      "or we must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it\n",
      "Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak\n",
      "And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well\n",
      "You are too precious to us to have such risk\n",
      "When we part tonight, you no more must question\n",
      "We shall tell you all in good time\n",
      "We are men and are able to bear\n",
      "but you must be our star and our hope, and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we are\n",
      "All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved\n",
      "but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their safety\n",
      "strength being the best safety\n",
      "through care of me\n",
      "but their minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow, I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me\n",
      "Morris resumed the discussion\n",
      "As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right now\n",
      "Time is everything with him\n",
      "and swift action on our part may save another victim\n",
      "I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether\n",
      "They have now gone off to Carfax, with means to get into the house\n",
      "Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep\n",
      "as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger\n",
      "I shall lie down and pretend to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns\n",
      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me\n",
      "I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning\n",
      "I was busy just at the moment\n",
      "The attendant added\n",
      "He seems very importunate, sir\n",
      "I have never seen him so eager\n",
      "I dont know but what, if you dont see him soon, he will have one of his violent fits\n",
      "I knew the man would not have said this without some cause, so I said All right\n",
      "Ill go now\n",
      "and I asked the others to wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my patient\n",
      "Take me with you, friend John, said the Professor\n",
      "His case in your diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on our case\n",
      "I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is disturbed\n",
      "May I come also\n",
      "asked Lord Godalming\n",
      "said Quincey Morris\n",
      "May I come\n",
      "said Harker\n",
      "I nodded, and we all went down the passage together\n",
      "We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him\n",
      "There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic\n",
      "and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane\n",
      "We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything\n",
      "His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home\n",
      "This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity\n",
      "I appeal to your friends, he said, they will, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case\n",
      "By the way, you have not introduced me\n",
      "I was so much astonished, that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment\n",
      "and, besides, there was a certain dignity in the mans manner, so much of the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction Lord Godalming\n",
      "Professor Van Helsing\n",
      "Quincey Morris, of Texas\n",
      "Renfield\n",
      "He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn\n",
      "Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the Windham\n",
      "I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no more\n",
      "He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him\n",
      "and in his youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much patronised on Derby night\n",
      "Morris, you should be proud of your great state\n",
      "Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have farreaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold alliance to the Stars and Stripes\n",
      "The power of Treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable\n",
      "What shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting Van Helsing\n",
      "Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix\n",
      "When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brainmatter, conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to one of a class\n",
      "You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties\n",
      "And I am sure that you, Dr\n",
      "Seward, humanitarian and medicojurist as well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances\n",
      "He made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm\n",
      "I think we were all staggered\n",
      "For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the mans character and history, that his reason had been restored\n",
      "and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning\n",
      "I thought it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable\n",
      "So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly\n",
      "that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of meeting his wishes\n",
      "This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly\n",
      "But I fear, Dr\n",
      "Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish\n",
      "I desire to go at once\n",
      "now\n",
      "this very hour\n",
      "this very moment, if I may\n",
      "Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract\n",
      "I am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as Dr\n",
      "Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment\n",
      "He looked at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely\n",
      "Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on\n",
      "Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition\n",
      "You have, I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally\n",
      "There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly\n",
      "Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request\n",
      "Let me ask for this concession\n",
      "boon, privilege, what you will\n",
      "I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others\n",
      "I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons\n",
      "but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty\n",
      "Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me\n",
      "Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends\n",
      "Again he looked at us all keenly\n",
      "I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end\n",
      "Van Helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look\n",
      "He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it afterwards\n",
      "for it was as of one addressing an equal\n",
      "Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight\n",
      "I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me\n",
      "a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind\n",
      "Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek\n",
      "He shook his head sadly, and with a look of poignant regret on his face\n",
      "The Professor went on\n",
      "Come, sir, bethink yourself\n",
      "You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness\n",
      "You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect\n",
      "If you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us\n",
      "Be wise, and help us\n",
      "and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish\n",
      "He still shook his head as he said\n",
      "Van Helsing, I have nothing to say\n",
      "Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment\n",
      "but I am not my own master in the matter\n",
      "I can only ask you to trust me\n",
      "If I am refused, the responsibility does not rest with me\n",
      "I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying\n",
      "Come, my friends, we have work to do\n",
      "As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient\n",
      "He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack\n",
      "My fears, however, were groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner\n",
      "As he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative\n",
      "I glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes\n",
      "so I became a little more fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing\n",
      "I had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat\n",
      "and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion\n",
      "My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition\n",
      "He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion\n",
      "Let me entreat you, Dr\n",
      "Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once\n",
      "Send me away how you will and where you will\n",
      "send keepers with me with whips and chains\n",
      "let them take me in a straitwaistcoat, manacled and legironed, even to a gaol\n",
      "but let me go out of this\n",
      "You dont know what you do by keeping me here\n",
      "I am speaking from the depths of my heart\n",
      "of my very soul\n",
      "You dont know whom you wrong, or how\n",
      "and I may not tell\n",
      "I may not tell\n",
      "By all you hold sacred\n",
      "by all you hold dear\n",

      "Cant you understand\n",
      "Will you never learn\n",
      "Dont you know that I am sane and earnest now\n",
      "that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul\n",
      "Oh, hear me\n",
      "Let me go\n",
      "let me go\n",
      "I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit\n",
      "so I took him by the hand and raised him up\n",
      "Come, I said sternly, no more of this\n",
      "we have had quite enough already\n",
      "Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly\n",
      "He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments\n",
      "Then, without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the bed\n",
      "The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had expected\n",
      "When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a quiet, wellbred voice\n",
      "You will, I trust, Dr\n",
      "Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later on, that I did what I could to convince you tonight\n",
      "CHAPTER XIX  JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL   I went with the party to the search with an easy mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well\n",
      "I am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work\n",
      "Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all\n",
      "but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us\n",
      "We were, I think, all a little upset by the scene with Mr\n",
      "When we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study\n",
      "Morris said to Dr\n",
      "Say, Jack, if that man wasnt attempting a bluff, he is about the sanest lunatic I ever saw\n",
      "Im not sure, but I believe that he had some serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance\n",
      "Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing added\n",
      "Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and Im glad of it, for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free\n",
      "But we live and learn, and in our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say\n",
      "All is best as they are\n",
      "Seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way\n",
      "I dont know but that I agree with you\n",
      "If that man had been an ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him\n",
      "but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads\n",
      "I cant forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth\n",
      "Besides, he called the Count lord and master, and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way\n",
      "That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic\n",
      "He certainly did seem earnest, though\n",
      "I only hope we have done what is best\n",
      "These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man\n",
      "The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way\n",
      "Friend John, have no fear\n",
      "We are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case\n",
      "we can only do as we deem best\n",
      "What else have we to hope for, except the pity of the good God\n",
      "Lord Godalming had slipped away for a few minutes, but now he returned\n",
      "He held up a little silver whistle, as he remarked\n",
      "That old place may be full of rats, and if so, Ive got an antidote on call\n",
      "Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out\n",
      "When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each\n",
      "Then he spoke\n",
      "My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of many kinds\n",
      "Our enemy is not merely spiritual\n",
      "Remember that he has the strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind\n",
      "and therefore breakable or crushable\n",
      "his are not amenable to mere strength\n",
      "A stronger man, or a body of men more strong in all than him, can at certain times hold him\n",
      "but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him\n",
      "We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his touch\n",
      "Keep this near your heart\n",
      "as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him\n",
      "put these flowers round your neck\n",
      "here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms\n",
      "for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this knife\n",
      "and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can fasten to your breast\n",
      "and for all, and above all at the last, this, which we must not desecrate needless\n",
      "This was a portion of Sacred Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me\n",
      "Each of the others was similarly equipped\n",
      "Now, he said, friend John, where are the skeleton keys\n",
      "If so that we can open the door, we need not break house by the window, as before at Miss Lucys\n",
      "Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead\n",
      "Presently he got one to suit\n",
      "after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty clang, shot back\n",
      "We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and it slowly opened\n",
      "It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in Dr\n",
      "Sewards diary of the opening of Miss Westenras tomb\n",
      "I fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they shrank back\n",
      "The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped into the open door\n",
      "In manus tuas, Domine\n",
      "he said, crossing himself as he passed over the threshold\n",
      "We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road\n",
      "The Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit\n",
      "Then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search\n",
      "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows\n",
      "I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us\n",
      "I suppose it was the recollection, so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible experience in Transylvania\n",
      "I think the feeling was common to us all, for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing\n",
      "The whole place was thick with dust\n",
      "The floor was seemingly inches deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked\n",
      "The walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of spiders webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down\n",
      "On a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys, with a timeyellowed label on each\n",
      "They had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor lifted them\n",
      "He turned to me and said\n",
      "You know this place, Jonathan\n",
      "You have copied maps of it, and you know it at least more than we do\n",
      "Which is the way to the chapel\n",
      "I had an idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to get admission to it\n",
      "so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands\n",
      "This is the spot, said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase\n",
      "With a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door\n",
      "We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered\n",
      "None of the others had met the Count at all at close quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in a ruined building open to the air\n",
      "but here the place was small and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul\n",
      "There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler air\n",
      "But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it\n",
      "It was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt\n",
      "it sickens me to think of it\n",
      "Every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness\n",
      "Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end\n",
      "but this was no ordinary case, and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations\n",
      "After the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses\n",
      "We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we began\n",
      "The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left\n",
      "we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest\n",
      "A glance was sufficient to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was no mistaking them\n",
      "There were only twentynine left out of the fifty\n",
      "Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still\n",
      "Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Counts evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor\n",
      "It was only for a moment, for, as Lord Godalming said, I thought I saw a face, but it was only the shadows, and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction, and stepped into the passage\n",
      "There was no sign of any one\n",
      "and as there were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid walls of the passage, there could be no hidingplace even for him\n",
      "I took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing\n",
      "A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which he was examining\n",
      "We all followed his movements with our eyes, for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars\n",
      "We all instinctively drew back\n",
      "The whole place was becoming alive with rats\n",
      "For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency\n",
      "Rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door, which Dr\n",
      "Seward had described from the outside, and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the huge bolts, and swung the door open\n",
      "Then, taking his little silver whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call\n",
      "It was answered from behind Dr\n",
      "Sewards house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house\n",
      "Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I noticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way\n",
      "But even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased\n",
      "They seemed to swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies\n",
      "The dogs dashed on, but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion\n",
      "The rats were multiplying in thousands, and we moved out\n",
      "Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him on the floor\n",
      "The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies\n",
      "They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished\n",
      "With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes\n",
      "We all seemed to find our spirits rise\n",
      "Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not\n",
      "but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution\n",
      "We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house\n",
      "We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit\n",
      "Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood\n",
      "The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front\n",
      "Van Helsing had taken the key of the halldoor from the bunch, and locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket when he had done\n",
      "So far, he said, our night has been eminently successful\n",
      "No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing\n",
      "More than all do I rejoice that this, our first\n",
      "and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous\n",
      "step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget\n",
      "One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beasts which are to the Counts command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power\n",
      "for look, these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mothers cry, though they come to him, they run pellmell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur\n",
      "We have other matters before us, other dangers, other fears\n",
      "and that monster\n",
      "he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight\n",
      "So be it that he has gone elsewhere\n",
      "It has given us opportunity to cry check in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls\n",
      "And now let us go home\n",
      "The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first nights work\n",
      "It may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril\n",
      "but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink\n",
      "The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfields room\n",
      "The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain\n",
      "I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it\n",
      "She looks paler than usual\n",
      "I hope the meeting tonight has not upset her\n",
      "I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations\n",
      "It is too great a strain for a woman to bear\n",
      "I did not think so at first, but I know better now\n",
      "Therefore I am glad that it is settled\n",
      "There may be things which would frighten her to hear\n",
      "and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment\n",
      "Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world\n",
      "I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours\n",
      "but I must be resolute, and tomorrow I shall keep dark over tonights doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened\n",
      "I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her\n",
      "I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all\n",
      "Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke\n",
      "Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream\n",
      "She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the day\n",
      "We now know of twentyone boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all\n",
      "Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner the matter is attended to the better\n",
      "I shall look up Thomas Snelling today\n",
      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room\n",
      "He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last nights work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind\n",
      "After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said\n",
      "Your patient interests me much\n",
      "May it be that with you I visit him this morning\n",
      "Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may be\n",
      "It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so sound\n",
      "I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to keep him waiting\n",
      "so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions\n",
      "Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient\n",
      "But, he answered, I want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things\n",
      "He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief\n",
      "Why do you smile, friend John\n",
      "Excuse me, I said, but the answer is here\n",
      "I laid my hand on the typewritten matter\n",
      "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs\n",
      "Harker entered the room\n",
      "Van Helsing smiled in turn\n",
      "he said\n",
      "Your memory is true, friend John\n",
      "I should have remembered\n",
      "And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study\n",
      "Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise\n",
      "I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand\n",
      "It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study\n",
      "Do I interrupt\n",
      "he asked politely as he stood at the door\n",
      "Not at all, I answered\n",
      "My work is finished, and I am free\n",
      "I can go with you now, if you like\n",
      "It is needless\n",
      "I have seen him\n",
      "I fear that he does not appraise me at much\n",
      "Our interview was short\n",
      "When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent\n",
      "I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume\n",
      "He made no reply whatever\n",
      "Dont you know me\n",
      "His answer was not reassuring I know you well enough\n",
      "you are the old fool Van Helsing\n",
      "I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else\n",
      "Damn all thickheaded Dutchmen\n",
      "Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at all\n",
      "Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic\n",
      "so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina\n",
      "Friend John, it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things\n",
      "Though we shall much miss her help, it is better so\n",
      "I agree with you with all my heart, I answered earnestly, for I did not want him to weaken in this matter\n",
      "Harker is better out of it\n",
      "Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have been in many tight places in our time\n",
      "but it is no place for a woman, and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time infallibly have wrecked her\n",

      "This morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier\n",
      "He spoke to me before he went out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Counts house\n",
      "And yet he must have known how terribly anxious I was\n",
      "Poor dear fellow\n",

      "Then if he has feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read\n",
      "I feel strangely sad and lowspirited today\n",
      "I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement\n",
      "Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to\n",
      "I didnt feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety\n",
      "I kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end\n",
      "Everything that one does seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored\n",
      "If I hadnt gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear Lucy would be with us now\n",
      "She hadnt taken to visiting the churchyard till I came, and if she hadnt come there in the daytime with me she wouldnt have walked there in her sleep\n",
      "and if she hadnt gone there at night and asleep, that monster couldnt have destroyed her as he did\n",
      "Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby\n",
      "There now, crying again\n",
      "I wonder what has come over me today\n",
      "I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew that I had been crying twice in one morning\n",
      "I, who never cried on my own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear\n",
      "the dear fellow would fret his heart out\n",
      "I shall put a bold face on, and if I do feel weepy, he shall never see it\n",
      "I suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn\n",
      "\n",
      "I cant quite remember how I fell asleep last night\n",
      "I remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr\n",
      "Renfields room, which is somewhere under this\n",
      "And then there was silence over everything, silence so profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window\n",
      "All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own\n",
      "Not a thing seemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate\n",
      "so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own\n",
      "I think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy creeping over me\n",
      "I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out and looked out of the window again\n",
      "The mist was spreading, and was now close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows\n",
      "The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part\n",
      "Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him\n",
      "I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears\n",
      "I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought\n",
      "but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the morning, when Jonathan woke me\n",
      "I think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was bending over me\n",
      "My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams\n",
      "I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back\n",
      "I was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act\n",
      "my feet, and my hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace\n",
      "And so I slept uneasily and thought\n",
      "Then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold\n",
      "I put back the clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around\n",
      "The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room\n",
      "Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window before I had come to bed\n",
      "I would have got out to make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will\n",
      "I lay still and endured\n",
      "that was all\n",
      "I closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids\n",
      "It is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine\n",
      "The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke\n",
      "or with the white energy of boiling water\n",
      "pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door\n",
      "It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye\n",
      "Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night\n",
      "Was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep\n",
      "But the pillar was composed of both the day and the nightguiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me\n",
      "till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St\n",
      "Marys Church\n",
      "Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness\n",
      "The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist\n",
      "I must be careful of such dreams, for they would unseat ones reason if there were too much of them\n",
      "I would get Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing or Dr\n",
      "Seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm them\n",
      "Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me\n",
      "Tonight I shall strive hard to sleep naturally\n",
      "If I do not, I shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral\n",
      "that cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good nights sleep\n",
      "Last night tired me more than if I had not slept at all\n",
      "Last night I slept, but did not dream\n",
      "I must have slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed\n",
      "but the sleep has not refreshed me, for today I feel terribly weak and spiritless\n",
      "I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing\n",
      "In the afternoon Mr\n",
      "Renfield asked if he might see me\n",
      "Poor man, he was very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless me\n",
      "Some way it affected me much\n",
      "I am crying when I think of him\n",
      "This is a new weakness, of which I must be careful\n",
      "Jonathan would be miserable if he knew I had been crying\n",
      "He and the others were out till dinnertime, and they all came in tired\n",
      "I did what I could to brighten them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how tired I was\n",
      "After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day\n",
      "I could see from Jonathans manner that he had something important to communicate\n",
      "I was not so sleepy as I should have been\n",
      "so before they went I asked Dr\n",
      "Seward to give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night before\n",
      "He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild\n",
      "\n",
      "I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof\n",
      "I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking\n",
      "I might want it\n",
      "Here comes sleep\n",
      "CHAPTER XX  JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL   I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything\n",
      "The very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch\n",
      "I learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the responsible person\n",
      "So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr\n",
      "Joseph Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a saucer\n",
      "He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own\n",
      "He remembered all about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dogseared notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick, halfobliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes\n",
      "There were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey\n",
      "If then the Count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more fully\n",
      "The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London\n",
      "He was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern shore, and on the south\n",
      "The north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme\n",
      "let alone the City itself and the very heart of fashionable London in the southwest and west\n",
      "I went back to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from Carfax\n",
      "He replied\n",
      "Well, guvnor, youve treated me wery ansome\n",
      "I had given him half a sovereign\n",
      "an Ill tell yer all I know\n",
      "I heard a man by the name of Bloxam say four nights ago in the Are an Ounds, in Pinchers Alley, as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at Purfect\n",
      "There aint amany such jobs as this ere, an Im thinkin that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut\n",
      "I asked if he could tell me where to find him\n",
      "I told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another halfsovereign to him\n",
      "So he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search then and there\n",
      "At the door he stopped, and said\n",
      "Look ere, guvnor, there aint no sense in me akeepin you ere\n",
      "I may find Sam soon, or I maynt\n",
      "but anyhow he aint like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight\n",
      "Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze\n",

      "But yed better be up arter im soon in the mornin, or maybe ye wont ketch im\n",
      "for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore\n",
      "This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change\n",
      "When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home\n",
      "Were on the track anyhow\n",
      "I am tired tonight, and want sleep\n",
      "Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale\n",
      "her eyes look as though she had been crying\n",
      "Poor dear, Ive no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others\n",
      "But it is best as it is\n",
      "It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken\n",
      "The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business\n",
      "I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest\n",
      "I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances\n",
      "Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision\n",
      "A long and trying and exciting day\n",
      "By the first post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenters pencil in a sprawling hand\n",
      "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth\n",
      "Arsk for the depite\n",
      "I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina\n",
      "She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well\n",
      "I determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter\n",
      "I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance\n",
      "I only saw Dr\n",
      "Seward for a moment, and told him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything\n",
      "I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potters Court\n",
      "Smollets spelling misled me, as I asked for Poters Court instead of Potters Court\n",
      "However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcorans lodginghouse\n",
      "When I asked the man who came to the door for the depite, he shook his head, and said I dunno im\n",
      "There aint no such a person ere\n",

      "Dont believe there aint nobody of that kind livin ere or anywheres\n",
      "I took out Smollets letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me\n",

      "Im the depity, he answered\n",
      "I saw at once that I was on the right track\n",
      "phonetic spelling had again misled me\n",
      "A halfcrown tip put the deputys knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr\n",
      "Bloxam, who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcorans, had left for his work at Poplar at five oclock that morning\n",
      "He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a newfangled wareus\n",
      "and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar\n",
      "It was twelve oclock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffeeshop, where some workmen were having their dinner\n",
      "One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new cold storage building\n",
      "and as this suited the condition of a newfangled wareus, I at once drove to it\n",
      "An interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam\n",
      "he was sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter\n",
      "He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing\n",
      "When I had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes\n",
      "main heavy ones\n",
      "with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose\n",
      "I asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied\n",
      "Well, guvnor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built\n",
      "It was a dusty old ouse, too, though nothin to the dustiness of the ouse we tooked the bloomin boxes from\n",
      "How did you get into the houses if they were both empty\n",
      "There was the old party what engaged me awaitin in the ouse at Purfleet\n",
      "He elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray\n",
      "Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldnt throw a shadder\n",
      "How this phrase thrilled through me\n",
      "Why, e took up is end o the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me apuffin an ablowin afore I could upend mine anyhow\n",
      "an Im no chicken, neither\n",
      "How did you get into the house in Piccadilly\n",
      "He was there too\n",
      "He must a started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an opened the door isself an elped me to carry the boxes into the all\n",
      "The whole nine\n",
      "Yus\n",
      "there was five in the first load an four in the second\n",
      "It was main dry work, an I dont so well remember ow I got ome\n",
      "I interrupted him\n",
      "Were the boxes left in the hall\n",
      "it was a big all, an there was nothin else in it\n",
      "I made one more attempt to further matters\n",
      "You didnt have any key\n",
      "Never used no key nor nothink\n",
      "The old gent, he opened the door isself an shut it again when I druv off\n",
      "I dont remember the last time\n",
      "but that was the beer\n",
      "And you cant remember the number of the house\n",
      "But ye neednt have no difficulty about that\n",
      "Its a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it, an igh steps up to the door\n",
      "I know them steps, avin ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper\n",
      "The old gent give them shillins, an they seein they got so much, they wanted more\n",
      "but e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps, till the lot of them went away cussin\n",
      "I thought that with this description I could find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started off for Piccadilly\n",
      "I had gained a new painful experience\n",
      "the Count could, it was evident, handle the earthboxes himself\n",
      "If so, time was precious\n",
      "for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved\n",
      "At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward\n",
      "beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula\n",
      "The house looked as though it had been long untenanted\n",
      "The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were up\n",
      "All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away\n",
      "It was evident that up to lately there had been a large noticeboard in front of the balcony\n",
      "it had, however, been roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining\n",
      "Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white\n",
      "I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the noticeboard intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house\n",
      "I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house\n",
      "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and nothing could be done\n",
      "so I went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter\n",
      "The mews were active, the Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation\n",
      "I asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house\n",
      "One of them said that he heard it had lately been taken, but he couldnt say from whom\n",
      "He told me, however, that up to very lately there had been a noticeboard of For Sale up, and that perhaps Mitchell, Sons,  Candy, the house agents, could tell me something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board\n",
      "I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled away\n",
      "It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I did not lose any time\n",
      "Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons,  Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in Sackville Street\n",
      "The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but uncommunicative in equal proportion\n",
      "Having once told me that the Piccadilly house\n",
      "which throughout our interview he called a mansion\n",
      "was sold, he considered my business as concluded\n",
      "When I asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and paused a few seconds before replying\n",
      "It is sold, sir\n",
      "Pardon me, I said, with equal politeness, but I have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it\n",
      "Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more\n",
      "It is sold, sir, was again his laconic reply\n",
      "Surely, I said, you do not mind letting me know so much\n",
      "But I do mind, he answered\n",
      "The affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons,  Candy\n",
      "This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him\n",
      "I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said\n",
      "Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence\n",
      "I am myself a professional man\n",
      "Here I handed him my card\n",
      "In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity\n",
      "I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale\n",
      "These words put a different complexion on affairs\n",
      "I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr\n",
      "Harker, and especially would I like to oblige his lordship\n",
      "We once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur Holmwood\n",
      "If you will let me have his lordships address I will consult the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his lordship by tonights post\n",
      "It will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship\n",
      "I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him, gave the address at Dr\n",
      "Sewards and came away\n",
      "It was now dark, and I was tired and hungry\n",
      "I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company and came down to Purfleet by the next train\n",
      "I found all the others at home\n",
      "Mina was looking tired and pale, but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude\n",
      "Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence\n",
      "It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task\n",
      "She seems somehow more reconciled\n",
      "or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders\n",
      "I am glad we made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing knowledge would be torture to her\n",
      "I could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were alone\n",
      "so after dinner\n",
      "followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves\n",
      "I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed\n",
      "The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me\n",
      "but there was much to be talked of and I came away\n",
      "Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us\n",
      "When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study\n",
      "In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information\n",
      "when I had finished Van Helsing said\n",
      "This has been a great days work, friend Jonathan\n",
      "Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes\n",
      "If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end\n",

      "His moods change so rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they always mean something more than his own wellbeing, they form a more than interesting study\n",
      "This morning, when I went to see him after his repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny\n",
      "He was, in fact, commanding destiny\n",
      "subjectively\n",
      "He did not really care for any of the things of mere earth\n",
      "he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals\n",
      "I thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked him\n",
      "What about the flies these times\n",
      "He smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way\n",
      "such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio\n",
      "as he answered me\n",
      "The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature\n",
      "its wings are typical of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties\n",
      "The ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly\n",
      "I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said quickly\n",
      "Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it\n",
      "His madness foiled his reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said\n",

      "I want no souls\n",
      "Life is all I want\n",

      "I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings\n",
      "If I may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied spiritually\n",
      "This was a poser to me\n",
      "I could not at the moment recall Enochs appositeness\n",
      "so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic\n",
      "And why with Enoch\n",
      "Because he walked with God\n",
      "I could not see the analogy, but did not like to admit it\n",
      "so I harked back to what he had denied\n",
      "So you dont care about life and you dont want souls\n",
      "I put my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him\n",
      "The effort succeeded\n",
      "for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as he replied\n",
      "I dont want any souls, indeed, indeed\n",
      "I couldnt use them if I had them\n",
      "they would be no manner of use to me\n",

      "After a short time I saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him\n",
      "He was sulky, and so I came away\n",
      "Later in the day he sent for me\n",
      "Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort\n",

      "he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue\n",
      "He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause\n",
      "I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again\n",
      "There was also another reason Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone\n",
      "I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part\n",
      "When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips\n",
      "What about souls\n",
      "It was evident then that my surmise had been correct\n",
      "Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic\n",
      "I determined to have the matter out\n",
      "What about them yourself\n",
      "He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer\n",
      "I dont want any souls\n",
      "he said in a feeble, apologetic way\n",
      "The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it\n",
      "to be cruel only to be kind\n",
      "You like life, and you want life\n",
      "but that is all right\n",
      "you neednt worry about that\n",
      "But, I asked, how are we to get the life without getting the soul also\n",
      "This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up\n",
      "A nice time youll have some time when youre flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you\n",
      "Youve got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls\n",
      "Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped\n",
      "There was something pathetic in it that touched me\n",
      "it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child\n",
      "only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white\n",
      "It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him\n",
      "The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears\n",
      "Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again\n",
      "He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head\n",
      "With a laugh he replied\n",
      "flies are poor things, after all\n",
      "After a pause he added, But I dont want their souls buzzing round me, all the same\n",
      "Or spiders\n",
      "Blow spiders\n",
      "Whats the use of spiders\n",
      "There isnt anything in them to eat or\n",
      "he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic\n",
      "I thought to myself, this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word drink\n",
      "what does it mean\n",
      "Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it\n",
      "I dont take any stock at all in such matters\n",
      "Rats and mice and such small deer, as Shakespeare has it, chickenfeed of the larder they might be called\n",
      "Im past all that sort of nonsense\n",
      "You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks, as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me\n",
      "I see, I said\n",
      "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in\n",
      "How would you like to breakfast on elephant\n",
      "What ridiculous nonsense you are talking\n",
      "He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard\n",
      "I wonder, I said reflectively, what an elephants soul is like\n",
      "The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his highhorse and became a child again\n",
      "I dont want an elephants soul, or any soul at all\n",
      "For a few moments he sat despondently\n",
      "Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement\n",
      "To hell with you and your souls\n",
      "he shouted\n",
      "Why do you plague me about souls\n",
      "Havent I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls\n",
      "He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle\n",
      "The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically\n",
      "Forgive me, Doctor\n",

      "I am sure you will understand\n",
      "He had evidently selfcontrol\n",
      "so when the attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew\n",
      "Renfield watched them go\n",
      "when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity and sweetness\n",

      "Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls\n",
      "Logically all these things point one way\n",
      "he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life\n",
      "He dreads the consequence\n",

      "Before going to bed I went round to the patients room and looked in through the observation trap\n",
      "He was sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration\n",

      "When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries\n",
      "there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity\n",
      "As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor\n",

      "The wounds of the face was superficial\n",
      "the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area\n",
      "The Professor thought a moment and said\n",
      "We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be\n",
      "the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury\n",
      "The whole motor area seems affected\n",

      "I heard your man call up Dr\n",

      "what has happened to him\n",
      "Poor, poor devil\n",
      "I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation\n",
      "for a short time, at all events\n",
      "He went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him\n",
      "we all watched in patience\n",
      "We shall wait, said Van Helsing, just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot\n",
      "for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing\n",
      "The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness\n",
      "I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsings face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come\n",
      "I dreaded the words that Renfield might speak\n",
      "I was positively afraid to think\n",
      "but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men who have heard the deathwatch\n",
      "The poor mans breathing came in uncertain gasps\n",
      "Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak\n",
      "but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility\n",
      "Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me\n",
      "I could almost hear the beating of my own heart\n",
      "and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer\n",
      "The silence finally became agonising\n",
      "I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture\n",
      "There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it\n",
      "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast\n",
      "he might die at any moment\n",
      "I looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine\n",

      "We shall operate just above the ear\n",
      "Without another word he made the operation\n",
      "For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous\n",
      "Then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest\n",
      "Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare\n",
      "This was continued for a few moments\n",
      "then it softened into a glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief\n",
      "He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said\n",
      "Ill be quiet, Doctor\n",
      "Tell them to take off the straitwaistcoat\n",
      "I have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot move\n",
      "Whats wrong with my face\n",
      "it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully\n",
      "He tried to turn his head\n",
      "but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back\n",
      "Then Van Helsing said in a quiet grave tone\n",
      "Tell us your dream, Mr\n",
      "As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he said\n",
      "That is Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing\n",
      "How good it is of you to be here\n",
      "Give me some water, my lips are dry\n",
      "and I shall try to tell you\n",
      "he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey\n",
      "The brandy\n",
      "it is in my study\n",
      "He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water\n",
      "We moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived\n",
      "It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I shall never forget, and said\n",
      "I must not deceive myself\n",
      "it was no dream, but all a grim reality\n",
      "Then his eyes roved round the room\n",
      "as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on\n",
      "If I were not sure already, I would know from them\n",
      "For an instant his eyes closed\n",
      "not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear\n",
      "when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed\n",
      "Quick, Doctor, quick\n",
      "I am dying\n",
      "I feel that I have but a few minutes\n",
      "and then I must go back to death\n",
      "Wet my lips with brandy again\n",
      "I have something that I must say before I die\n",
      "or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow\n",
      "It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go away\n",
      "I couldnt speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied\n",
      "but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now\n",
      "I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me\n",
      "it seemed hours\n",
      "Then there came a sudden peace to me\n",
      "My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was\n",
      "I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was\n",
      "As he spoke, Van Helsings eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard\n",
      "He did not, however, betray himself\n",
      "he nodded slightly and said Go on, in a low voice\n",
      "Renfield proceeded\n",
      "He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before\n",
      "but he was solid then\n",
      "not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a mans when angry\n",
      "He was laughing with his red mouth\n",
      "the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking\n",
      "I wouldnt ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to\n",
      "just as he had wanted all along\n",
      "Then he began promising me things\n",
      "not in words but by doing them\n",
      "He was interrupted by a word from the Professor\n",
      "By making them happen\n",
      "just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining\n",
      "Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings\n",
      "and big moths, in the night, with skull and crossbones on their backs\n",
      "Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously\n",
      "The what you call the Deathshead Moth\n",
      "The patient went on without stopping\n",
      "Then he began to whisper Rats, rats, rats\n",
      "Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life\n",
      "and dogs to eat them, and cats too\n",
      "all red blood, with years of life in it\n",
      "and not merely buzzing flies\n",
      "I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do\n",
      "Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house\n",
      "He beckoned me to the window\n",
      "I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words\n",
      "A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire\n",
      "and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red\n",
      "like His, only smaller\n",
      "He held up his hand, and they all stopped\n",
      "and I thought he seemed to be saying All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me\n",
      "And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes\n",
      "and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him Come in, Lord and Master\n",
      "The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide\n",
      "just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour\n",
      "His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued\n",
      "but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced\n",
      "I was about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me Let him go on\n",
      "Do not interrupt him\n",
      "he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought\n",
      "He proceeded\n",
      "All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blowfly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him\n",
      "When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I got mad with him\n",
      "He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one\n",
      "He didnt even smell the same as he went by me\n",
      "I couldnt hold him\n",
      "I thought that, somehow, Mrs\n",
      "Harker had come into the room\n",
      "The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better\n",
      "They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered\n",
      "his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still\n",
      "Renfield went on without noticing\n",
      "Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasnt the same\n",
      "it was like tea after the teapot had been watered\n",
      "Here we all moved, but no one said a word\n",
      "he went on\n",
      "I didnt know that she was here till she spoke\n",
      "and she didnt look the same\n",
      "I dont care for the pale people\n",
      "I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out\n",
      "I didnt think of it at the time\n",
      "but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her\n",
      "I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still\n",
      "So when He came tonight I was ready for Him\n",
      "I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight\n",
      "I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength\n",
      "and as I knew I was a madman\n",
      "at times anyhow\n",
      "I resolved to use my power\n",
      "Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle with me\n",
      "I held tight\n",
      "and I thought I was going to win, for I didnt mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes\n",
      "They burned into me, and my strength became like water\n",
      "He slipped through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down\n",
      "There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door\n",
      "His voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous\n",
      "Van Helsing stood up instinctively\n",
      "We know the worst now, he said\n",
      "He is here, and we know his purpose\n",
      "It may not be too late\n",
      "Let us be armed\n",
      "the same as we were the other night, but lose no time\n",
      "there is not an instant to spare\n",
      "There was no need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words\n",
      "we shared them in common\n",
      "We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Counts house\n",
      "The Professor had his ready, and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said\n",
      "They never leave me\n",
      "and they shall not till this unhappy business is over\n",
      "Be wise also, my friends\n",
      "It is no common enemy that we deal with\n",
      "alas\n",
      "that that dear Madam Mina should suffer\n",
      "He stopped\n",
      "his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart\n",
      "Outside the Harkers door we paused\n",
      "Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said\n",
      "Should we disturb her\n",
      "We must, said Van Helsing grimly\n",
      "If the door be locked, I shall break it in\n",
      "May it not frighten her terribly\n",
      "It is unusual to break into a ladys room\n",
      "Van Helsing said solemnly, You are always right\n",
      "but this is life and death\n",
      "All chambers are alike to the doctor\n",
      "and even were they not they are all as one to me tonight\n",
      "Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove\n",
      "and you too, my friends\n",
      "He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield\n",
      "We threw ourselves against it\n",
      "with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room\n",
      "The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees\n",
      "What I saw appalled me\n",
      "I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still\n",
      "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see\n",
      "On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor\n",
      "Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the whiteclad figure of his wife\n",
      "By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black\n",
      "His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count\n",
      "in every way, even to the scar on his forehead\n",
      "With his left hand he held both Mrs\n",
      "Harkers hands, keeping them away with her arms at full tension\n",
      "his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom\n",
      "Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the mans bare breast which was shown by his tornopen dress\n",
      "The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kittens nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink\n",
      "As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap into it\n",
      "His eyes flamed red with devilish passion\n",
      "the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge\n",
      "and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blooddripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast\n",
      "With a wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us\n",
      "But by this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred Wafer\n",
      "The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back\n",
      "Further and further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced\n",
      "The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky\n",
      "and when the gaslight sprang up under Quinceys match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour\n",
      "This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to its old position\n",
      "Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs\n",
      "Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so earpiercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day\n",
      "For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray\n",
      "Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin\n",
      "from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood\n",
      "her eyes were mad with terror\n",
      "Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Counts terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief\n",
      "Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the room\n",
      "Van Helsing whispered to me\n",
      "Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce\n",
      "We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers herself\n",
      "I must wake him\n",
      "He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear\n",
      "I raised the blind, and looked out of the window\n",
      "There was much moonshine\n",
      "and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yewtree\n",
      "It puzzled me to think why he was doing this\n",
      "but at the instant I heard Harkers quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness, and turned to the bed\n",
      "On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement\n",
      "He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up\n",
      "His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him\n",
      "instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook\n",
      "In Gods name what does this mean\n",
      "Harker cried out\n",
      "Seward, Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing, what is it\n",
      "What has happened\n",
      "What is wrong\n",
      "Mina, dear, what is it\n",
      "What does that blood mean\n",
      "My God, my God\n",
      "has it come to this\n",
      "and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together\n",
      "Good God help us\n",
      "oh, help her\n",
      "With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,\n",
      "all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion\n",
      "What has happened\n",
      "Tell me all about it\n",
      "he cried without pausing\n",
      "Van Helsing, you love Mina, I know\n",
      "Oh, do something to save her\n",
      "It cannot have gone too far yet\n",
      "Guard her while I look for him\n",
      "His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him instantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out\n",
      "no\n",
      "Jonathan, you must not leave me\n",
      "I have suffered enough tonight, God knows, without the dread of his harming you\n",
      "You must stay with me\n",
      "Stay with these friends who will watch over you\n",
      "Her expression became frantic as she spoke\n",
      "and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely\n",
      "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both\n",
      "The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness\n",
      "Do not fear, my dear\n",
      "We are here\n",
      "and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach\n",
      "You are safe for tonight\n",
      "and we must be calm and take counsel together\n",
      "She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her husbands breast\n",
      "When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops\n",
      "The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs\n",
      "Unclean, unclean\n",
      "I must touch him or kiss him no more\n",
      "Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear\n",
      "To this he spoke out resolutely\n",
      "Nonsense, Mina\n",
      "It is a shame to me to hear such a word\n",
      "I would not hear it of you\n",
      "and I shall not hear it from you\n",
      "May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us\n",
      "He put out his arms and folded her to his breast\n",
      "and for a while she lay there sobbing\n",
      "He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils\n",
      "his mouth was set as steel\n",
      "After a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous power to the utmost\n",
      "And now, Dr\n",
      "Seward, tell me all about it\n",
      "Too well I know the broad fact\n",
      "tell me all that has been\n",
      "I told him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness\n",
      "but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to the open wound in his breast\n",
      "It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair\n",
      "Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door\n",
      "They entered in obedience to our summons\n",
      "Van Helsing looked at me questioningly\n",
      "I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves\n",
      "so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done\n",
      "To which Lord Godalming answered\n",
      "I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms\n",
      "I looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone\n",
      "He had, however\n",
      "He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed\n",
      "Van Helsing said gravely\n",
      "Go on, friend Arthur\n",
      "We want here no more concealments\n",
      "Our hope now is in knowing all\n",
      "Tell freely\n",
      "So Art went on\n",
      "He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place\n",
      "All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes\n",
      "the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames\n",
      "Here I interrupted\n",
      "Thank God there is the other copy in the safe\n",
      "His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him\n",
      "I looked into Renfields room\n",
      "but there was no trace there except\n",
      "\n",
      "Again he paused\n",
      "Go on, said Harker hoarsely\n",
      "so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added except that the poor fellow is dead\n",
      "Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly\n",
      "Gods will be done\n",
      "I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something\n",
      "but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing\n",
      "Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked\n",
      "And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell\n",
      "A little, he answered\n",
      "It may be much eventually, but at present I cant say\n",
      "I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would go when he left the house\n",
      "I did not see him\n",
      "but I saw a bat rise from Renfields window, and flap westward\n",
      "I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax\n",
      "but he evidently sought some other lair\n",
      "He will not be back tonight\n",
      "for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close\n",
      "We must work tomorrow\n",
      "He said the latter words through his shut teeth\n",
      "For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating\n",
      "then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs\n",
      "Harkers head\n",
      "And now, Madam Mina\n",
      "poor, dear, dear Madam Mina\n",
      "tell us exactly what happened\n",
      "God knows that I do not want that you be pained\n",
      "but it is need that we know all\n",
      "For now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest\n",
      "The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so\n",
      "and now is the chance that we may live and learn\n",
      "The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast\n",
      "Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast\n",
      "The other hand was locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly\n",
      "After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began\n",
      "I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act\n",
      "I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind\n",
      "all of them connected with death, and vampires\n",
      "with blood, and pain, and trouble\n",

      "How long this horrible thing lasted I know not\n",

      "With a great effort she recovered herself and went on\n",

      "You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs\n",

      "In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily to the same result\n",

      "for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant\n",

      "She was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we began to discuss what we were to do\n",
      "I told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use\n",
      "and was to keep the record as she had done before\n",
      "She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do\n",
      "if pleased could be used in connection with so grim an interest\n",
      "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work\n",
      "It is perhaps well, he said, that at our meeting after our visit to Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earthboxes that lay there\n",
      "Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others\n",
      "but now he does not know our intentions\n",
      "Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use them as of old\n",
      "We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them\n",

      "He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies\n",
      "If he go through a doorway, he must open the door like a mortal\n",
      "And so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them\n",
      "So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure\n",
      "Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Minas life and happiness were flying from us, since whilst we talked action was impossible\n",
      "But Van Helsing held up his hand warningly\n",
      "Nay, friend Jonathan, he said, in this, the quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say\n",
      "We shall all act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come\n",
      "But think, in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly\n",
      "The Count may have many houses which he has bought\n",
      "Of them he will have deeds of purchase, keys and other things\n",
      "He will have paper that he write on\n",
      "he will have his book of cheques\n",
      "There are many belongings that he must have somewhere\n",
      "why not in this place so central, so quiet, where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice\n",
      "We shall go there and search that house\n",
      "and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so we run down our old fox\n",
      "is it not\n",
      "Then let us come at once, I cried, we are wasting the precious, precious time\n",
      "The Professor did not move, but simply said\n",
      "And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly\n",
      "I cried\n",
      "We shall break in if need be\n",
      "And your police\n",
      "where will they be, and what will they say\n",
      "I was staggered\n",
      "but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it\n",
      "So I said, as quietly as I could\n",
      "Dont wait more than need be\n",
      "you know, I am sure, what torture I am in\n",
      "Ah, my child, that I do\n",
      "and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish\n",
      "But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at movement\n",
      "Then will come our time\n",
      "I have thought and thought, and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all\n",
      "Now we wish to get into the house, but we have no key\n",
      "is it not so\n",
      "Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could not still get it\n",
      "and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker, what would you do\n",
      "I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the lock for me\n",
      "And your police, they would interfere, would they not\n",
      "not if they knew the man was properly employed\n",
      "Then, he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one\n",
      "Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever\n",
      "oh, so clever\n",
      "in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter\n",
      "No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world\n",
      "and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere\n",
      "I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and got in\n",
      "Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police\n",
      "Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice\n",
      "and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them\n",
      "Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time\n",
      "And your police and other authority help him all they can\n",
      "And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been\n",
      "This was all done en règle\n",
      "and in our work we shall be en règle too\n",
      "We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange\n",
      "but we shall go after ten oclock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house\n",
      "I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Minas face became relaxed a thought\n",
      "there was hope in such good counsel\n",
      "Van Helsing went on\n",
      "When once within that house we may find more clues\n",
      "at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earthboxes\n",
      "at Bermondsey and Mile End\n",
      "Lord Godalming stood up\n",
      "I can be of some use here, he said\n",
      "I shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient\n",
      "Look here, old fellow, said Morris, it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking\n",
      "but dont you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes\n",
      "It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east\n",
      "and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to\n",
      "Friend Quincey is right\n",
      "said the Professor\n",
      "His head is what you call in plane with the horizon\n",
      "It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may\n",
      "Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night\n",
      "She was very, very pale\n",
      "almost ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence\n",
      "I did not mention this last, lest it should give her needless pain\n",
      "but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood\n",
      "As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper\n",
      "but the time as yet was short, and there was time for fear\n",
      "When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt\n",
      "It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Counts lair close at hand\n",
      "In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction\n",
      "and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue\n",
      "As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly\n",
      "that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them\n",
      "It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there\n",
      "At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force\n",
      "To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject\n",
      "but Mina would not listen to my objection\n",
      "She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be useful\n",
      "that amongst the Counts papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania\n",
      "and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Counts extraordinary power\n",
      "I had to give in, for Minas resolution was fixed\n",
      "she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together\n",
      "As for me, she said, I have no fear\n",
      "Things have been as bad as they can be\n",
      "and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort\n",
      "Go, my husband\n",
      "God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present\n",
      "So I started up crying out Then in Gods name let us come at once, for we are losing time\n",
      "The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we think\n",
      "said Van Helsing, holding up his hand\n",
      "I asked\n",
      "Do you forget, he said, with actually a smile, that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep late\n",
      "Did I forget\n",
      "shall I ever\n",
      "can I ever\n",
      "Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene\n",
      "Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance\n",
      "but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered whilst she moaned\n",
      "Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience\n",
      "He had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort\n",
      "When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her\n",
      "Oh, Madam Mina, he said, dear, dear Madam Mina, alas\n",
      "that I of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful\n",
      "These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so\n",
      "but you will forget it, will you not\n",
      "He bent low beside her as he spoke\n",
      "she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely\n",
      "No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember\n",
      "and with it I have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all together\n",
      "Now, you must all be going soon\n",
      "Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we may be strong\n",
      "Breakfast was a strange meal to us all\n",
      "We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us\n",
      "When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said\n",
      "Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise\n",
      "Are we all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemys lair\n",
      "armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack\n",
      "We all assured him\n",
      "Then it is well\n",
      "Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset\n",
      "and before then we shall return\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall return\n",
      "But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack\n",
      "I have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not enter\n",
      "Now let me guard yourself\n",
      "On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and\n",
      "There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear\n",
      "As he had placed the Wafer on Minas forehead, it had seared it\n",
      "had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal\n",
      "My poor darlings brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it\n",
      "and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream\n",
      "But the words to her thought came quickly\n",
      "the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement\n",
      "Pulling her beautiful hair over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out\n",
      "Unclean\n",
      "Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh\n",
      "I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day\n",
      "They all paused\n",
      "I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting my arms around held her tight\n",
      "For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently\n",
      "Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely\n",
      "so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself\n",
      "It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon\n",
      "And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of Gods knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know\n",
      "For so surely as we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us\n",
      "Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in obedience to His Will\n",
      "It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through stripes and shame\n",
      "through tears and blood\n",
      "through doubts and fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man\n",
      "There was hope in his words, and comfort\n",
      "and they made for resignation\n",
      "Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old mans hands and bent over and kissed it\n",
      "Then without a word we all knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other\n",
      "We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved\n",
      "and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us\n",
      "It was then time to start\n",
      "So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day\n",
      "and we set out\n",
      "To one thing I have made up my mind if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone\n",
      "I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many\n",
      "just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks\n",
      "We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion\n",
      "It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew\n",
      "Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded with our task\n",
      "We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house\n",
      "and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last\n",
      "Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them\n",
      "And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do\n",
      "We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use\n",
      "He has chosen this earth because it has been holy\n",
      "Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still\n",
      "It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to God\n",
      "As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open\n",
      "The earth smelled musty and close\n",
      "but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor\n",
      "Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked\n",
      "One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all appearance\n",
      "but in each was a portion of the Host\n",
      "When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly\n",
      "So much is already done\n",
      "If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Minas forehead all white as ivory and with no stain\n",
      "As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum\n",
      "I looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina\n",
      "I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished\n",
      "She nodded in reply to show that she understood\n",
      "The last I saw, she was waving her hand in farewell\n",
      "It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform\n",
      "I have written this in the train\n",
      "Just before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to me\n",
      "Quincey and I will find a locksmith\n",
      "You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty\n",
      "for under the circumstances it wouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empty house\n",
      "But you are a solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better\n",
      "I demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium, but he went on Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us\n",
      "My title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along\n",
      "You had better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house\n",
      "and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away, do you all come across\n",
      "We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in\n",
      "The advice is good\n",
      "said Van Helsing, so we said no more\n",
      "Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another\n",
      "At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park\n",
      "My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and sprucelooking neighbours\n",
      "We sat down on a bench within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible\n",
      "The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others\n",
      "At length we saw a fourwheeler drive up\n",
      "Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris\n",
      "and down from the box descended a thickset working man with his rushwoven basket of tools\n",
      "Morris paid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away\n",
      "Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done\n",
      "The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along\n",
      "The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him\n",
      "After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion\n",
      "Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark\n",
      "Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a goodsized bunch of keys\n",
      "selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it\n",
      "After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third\n",
      "All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall\n",
      "We sat still\n",
      "my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsings went cold altogether\n",
      "We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag\n",
      "Then he held the door partly open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock\n",
      "This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him something\n",
      "The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed\n",
      "not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction\n",
      "When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door\n",
      "It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar\n",
      "The place smells so vilely, said the latter as we came in\n",
      "It did indeed smell vilely\n",
      "like the old chapel at Carfax\n",
      "and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty freely\n",
      "We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack\n",
      "for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house\n",
      "In the diningroom, which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth\n",
      "Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought\n",
      "Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box\n",
      "First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stoneflagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house\n",
      "There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being overlooked\n",
      "We did not lose any time in examining the chests\n",
      "With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel\n",
      "It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects\n",
      "After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the diningroom contained any effects which might belong to the Count\n",
      "and so we proceeded to minutely examine them\n",
      "They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great diningroom table\n",
      "There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle\n",
      "deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey\n",
      "notepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink\n",
      "All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust\n",
      "There were also a clothes brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin\n",
      "the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood\n",
      "Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses\n",
      "When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places\n",
      "The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting their return\n",
      "or the coming of the Count\n",
      "CHAPTER XXIII  DR\n",
      "SEWARDS DIARY   The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris\n",
      "The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time\n",
      "I could see his beneficent purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker\n",
      "The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see\n",
      "Last night he was a frank, happylooking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair\n",
      "Today he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and griefwritten lines of his face\n",
      "His energy is still intact\n",
      "in fact, he is like a living flame\n",
      "This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period\n",
      "he will then, in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life\n",
      "Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his\n",
      "\n",
      "The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active\n",
      "What he has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest\n",
      "So well as I can remember, here it is\n",
      "I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster\n",
      "and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out\n",
      "All through there are signs of his advance\n",
      "not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it\n",
      "As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of BudaPesth, he was in life a most wonderful man\n",
      "Soldier, statesman, and alchemist\n",
      "which latter was the highest development of the scienceknowledge of his time\n",
      "He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse\n",
      "He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay\n",
      "Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death\n",
      "though it would seem that memory was not all complete\n",
      "In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child\n",
      "but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of mans stature\n",
      "He is experimenting, and doing it well\n",
      "and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet\n",
      "he may be yet if we fail\n",
      "the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life\n",
      "Harker groaned and said, And this is all arrayed against my darling\n",
      "But how is he experimenting\n",
      "The knowledge may help us to defeat him\n",
      "He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely\n",
      "that big childbrain of his is working\n",
      "Well for us, it is, as yet, a childbrain\n",
      "for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power\n",
      "However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow\n",
      "Festina lente may well be his motto\n",
      "I fail to understand, said Harker wearily\n",
      "Oh, do be more plain to me\n",
      "Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain\n",
      "The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke\n",
      "Ah, my child, I will be plain\n",
      "Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally\n",
      "How he has been making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend Johns home\n",
      "for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate\n",
      "But these are not his most important experiments\n",
      "Do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others\n",
      "He knew not then but that must be so\n",
      "But all the time that so great childbrain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box\n",
      "So he began to help\n",
      "and then, when he found that this be allright, he try to move them all alone\n",
      "And so he progress, and he scatter these graves of him\n",
      "and none but he know where they are hidden\n",
      "He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground\n",
      "So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well\n",
      "and none may know these are his hidingplace\n",
      "But, my child, do not despair\n",
      "this knowledge come to him just too late\n",
      "Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him\n",
      "and before the sunset this shall be so\n",
      "Then he have no place where he can move and hide\n",
      "I delayed this morning that so we might be sure\n",
      "Is there not more at stake for us than for him\n",
      "Then why we not be even more careful than him\n",
      "By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us\n",
      "Today is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance\n",
      "there are five of us when those absent ones return\n",
      "Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postmans knock of the telegraph boy\n",
      "We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it\n",
      "The boy handed in a despatch\n",
      "The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud\n",
      "Look out for D\n",
      "He has just now, 1245, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South\n",
      "He seems to be going the round and may want to see you Mina\n",
      "There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harkers voice\n",
      "Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet\n",
      "Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said\n",
      "God will act in His own way and time\n",
      "Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet\n",
      "for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings\n",
      "I care for nothing now, he answered hotly, except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation\n",
      "I would sell my soul to do it\n",
      "Oh, hush, hush, my child\n",
      "said Van Helsing\n",
      "God does not purchase souls in this wise\n",
      "and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith\n",
      "But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina\n",
      "Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words\n",
      "Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and today shall see the end\n",
      "The time is coming for action\n",
      "today this Vampire is limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change\n",
      "It will take him time to arrive here\n",
      "see, it is twenty minutes past one\n",
      "and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick\n",
      "What we must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first\n",
      "About half an hour after we had received Mrs\n",
      "Harkers telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door\n",
      "It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professors heart and mine beat loudly\n",
      "We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall\n",
      "we each held ready to use our various armaments\n",
      "the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right\n",
      "Van Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action\n",
      "The gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris\n",
      "They came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall\n",
      "It is all right\n",
      "We found both places\n",
      "six boxes in each and we destroyed them all\n",
      "asked the Professor\n",
      "We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said\n",
      "Theres nothing to do but to wait here\n",
      "If, however, he doesnt turn up by five oclock, we must start off\n",
      "for it wont do to leave Mrs\n",
      "Harker alone after sunset\n",
      "He will be here before long now, said Van Helsing, who had been consulting his pocketbook\n",
      "Nota bene, in Madams telegram he went south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one oclock\n",
      "That he went south has a meaning for us\n",
      "He is as yet only suspicious\n",
      "and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least\n",
      "You must have been at Bermondsey only a short time before him\n",
      "That he is not here already shows that he went to Mile End next\n",
      "This took him some time\n",
      "for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way\n",
      "Believe me, my friends, we shall not have long to wait now\n",
      "We should have ready some plan of attack, so that we may throw away no chance\n",
      "Hush, there is no time now\n",
      "Have all your arms\n",
      "He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door\n",
      "I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself\n",
      "In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly\n",
      "Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively\n",
      "With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position\n",
      "Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door\n",
      "Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window\n",
      "We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness\n",
      "The slow, careful steps came along the hall\n",
      "the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise\n",
      "at least he feared it\n",
      "Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him\n",
      "There was something so pantherlike in the movement\n",
      "something so unhuman, that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming\n",
      "The first to act was Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house\n",
      "As the Count saw us, a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eyeteeth long and pointed\n",
      "but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lionlike disdain\n",
      "His expression again changed as, with a single impulse, we all advanced upon him\n",
      "It was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what we were to do\n",
      "I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything\n",
      "Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him\n",
      "The blow was a powerful one\n",
      "only the diabolical quickness of the Counts leap back saved him\n",
      "A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart\n",
      "As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of gold fell out\n",
      "The expression of the Counts face was so hellish, that for a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke\n",
      "Instinctively I moved forward with a protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand\n",
      "I felt a mighty power fly along my arm\n",
      "and it was without surprise that I saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us\n",
      "It would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity\n",
      "of anger and hellish rage\n",
      "which came over the Counts face\n",
      "His waxen hue became greenishyellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound\n",

      "he fear time, he fear want\n",
      "For if not, why he hurry so\n",
      "His very tone betray him, or my ears deceive\n",

      "You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so\n",
      "For me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he return\n",
      "As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket\n",
      "took the titledeeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with a match\n",
      "Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the Count\n",
      "He had, however, bolted the stable door\n",
      "and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him\n",
      "Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back of the house\n",

      "The poor fellow was quite broken down\n",
      "now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress\n",
      "he was thinking of his wife\n",
      "With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs\n",
      "Harker waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness\n",
      "When she saw our faces, her own became as pale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer\n",
      "and then she said cheerfully\n",
      "I can never thank you all enough\n",
      "Oh, my poor darling\n",

      "There was no place for words in his sublime misery\n",
      "We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us all up somewhat\n",
      "It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry people\n",
      "for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast\n",
      "or the sense of companionship may have helped us\n",
      "but anyhow we were all less miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope\n",
      "True to our promise, we told Mrs\n",
      "Harker everything which had passed\n",
      "and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness\n",
      "When we came to the part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to her husbands arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come\n",
      "She said nothing, however, till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up to the present time\n",
      "Then without letting go her husbands hand she stood up amongst us and spoke\n",
      "Oh, that I could give any idea of the scene\n",
      "of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth\n",
      "remembering whence and how it came\n",
      "her loving kindness against our grim hate\n",
      "her tender faith against all our fears and doubting\n",
      "and we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and purity and faith, was outcast from God\n",
      "Jonathan, she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness, Jonathan dear, and you all my true, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time\n",
      "I know that you must fight\n",
      "that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter\n",

      "Just think what will be his joy when he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality\n",
      "You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may not hold your hands from his destruction\n",
      "As she spoke I could see her husbands face darken and draw together, as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core\n",
      "Instinctively the clasp on his wifes hand grew closer, till his knuckles looked white\n",
      "She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever\n",
      "As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke\n",
      "May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at\n",
      "If beyond it I could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it\n",
      "oh, hush\n",
      "in the name of the good God\n",

      "Mina opened her eyes\n",
      "but she did not seem the same woman\n",
      "There was a faraway look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me\n",
      "Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in\n",

      "In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darlings white forehead\n",
      "Whilst that lasts, there can be no disbelief\n",
      "And afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear\n",
      "Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been over all the diaries again and again\n",
      "Somehow, although the reality seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less\n",
      "There is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting\n",
      "Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good\n",
      "I shall try to think as she does\n",
      "We have never spoken to each other yet of the future\n",
      "It is better to wait till we see the Professor and the others after their investigations\n",
      "The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run for me again\n",

      "Mina Harkers Journal\n",
      "Our meeting for report\n",
      "Present Professor Van Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr\n",
      "Seward, Mr\n",
      "Quincey Morris, Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker\n",
      "Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape\n",
      "As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that he must go by the Danube mouth\n",
      "or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since by that way he come\n",
      "It was a dreary blank that was before us\n",
      "Omne ignotum pro magnifico\n",
      "and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the Black Sea last night\n",
      "He was in sailing ship, since Madam Mina tell of sails being set\n",
      "These not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the Times, and so we go, by suggestion of Lord Godalming, to your Lloyds, where are note of all ships that sail, however so small\n",
      "There we find that only one BlackSeabound ship go out with the tide\n",
      "She is the Czarina Catherine, and she sail from Doolittles Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the Danube\n",
      "said I, this is the ship whereon is the Count\n",
      "So off we go to Doolittles Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office\n",
      "From him we inquire of the goings of the Czarina Catherine\n",
      "He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same\n",
      "and when Quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he still better fellow and humble servant to us\n",
      "He come with us, and ask many men who are rough and hot\n",
      "these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty\n",
      "They say much of blood and bloom, and of others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean\n",
      "but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know\n",
      "They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five oclock comes a man so hurry\n",
      "A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning\n",
      "That he be all in black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time\n",
      "That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the Black Sea and for where\n",
      "Some took him to the office and then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangplank, and ask that the captain come to him\n",
      "The captain come, when told that he will be pay well\n",
      "and though he swear much at the first he agree to term\n",
      "Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired\n",
      "He go there and soon he come again, himself driving cart on which a great box\n",
      "this he himself lift down, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship\n",
      "He give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place\n",
      "but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be\n",
      "But he say no\n",
      "that he come not yet, for that he have much to do\n",
      "Whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick\n",
      "with blood\n",
      "for that his ship will leave the place\n",
      "before the turn of the tide\n",
      "with blood\n",
      "Then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit\n",
      "but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon\n",
      "The captain swear again, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing\n",
      "Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesnt want no Frenchmen\n",
      "with bloom upon them and also with blood\n",
      "in his ship\n",
      "with blood on her also\n",
      "And so, after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms, he departed\n",
      "No one knew where he went or bloomin well cared, as they said, for they had something else to think of\n",
      "well with blood again\n",
      "for it soon became apparent to all that the Czarina Catherine would not sail as was expected\n",
      "A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew, and grew\n",
      "till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her\n",
      "The captain swore polyglot\n",
      "very polyglot\n",
      "polyglot with bloom and blood\n",
      "but he could do nothing\n",
      "The water rose and rose\n",
      "and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether\n",
      "He was in no friendly mood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed\n",
      "Then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box\n",
      "old and with much bloom and blood\n",
      "were in hell\n",
      "But the thin man did not be offend, and went down with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog\n",
      "He must have come off by himself, for none notice him\n",
      "Indeed they thought not of him\n",
      "for soon the fog begin to melt away, and all was clear again\n",
      "My friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captains swears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf\n",
      "However, the ship went out on the ebb tide\n",
      "and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth\n",
      "She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea\n",
      "And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the Danube mouth\n",
      "To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick\n",
      "and when we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there\n",
      "Our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset\n",
      "for then he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should\n",
      "There are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan\n",
      "We know all about where he go\n",
      "for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be\n",
      "The box we seek is to be landed in Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present his credentials\n",
      "and so our merchant friend will have done his part\n",
      "When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and have inquiry made at Varna, we say no\n",
      "for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs\n",
      "It must be done by us alone and in our own way\n",
      "Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain that the Count had remained on board the ship\n",
      "He replied We have the best proof of that your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this morning\n",
      "I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the Count, for oh\n",
      "I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that he would surely go if the others went\n",
      "He answered in growing passion, at first quietly\n",
      "As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men\n",
      "Yes, it is necessary\n",
      "necessary\n",
      "For your sake in the first, and then for the sake of humanity\n",
      "This monster has done much harm already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing\n",
      "All this have I told these others\n",
      "you, my dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or in that of your husband\n",
      "I have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land\n",
      "barren of peoples\n",
      "and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the work of centuries\n",
      "Were another of the UnDead, like him, to try to do what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been, or that will be, could aid him\n",
      "With this one, all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way\n",
      "The very place, where he have been alive, UnDead for all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world\n",
      "There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither\n",
      "There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify\n",
      "Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way\n",
      "and in himself were from the first some great qualities\n",
      "In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver heart, than any man\n",
      "In him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost\n",
      "and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive, so his brain grow too\n",
      "All this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him\n",
      "for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and are, symbolic of good\n",
      "And now this is what he is to us\n",
      "He have infect you\n",
      "oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such\n",
      "but it is for good of you that I speak\n",
      "He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no more, you have only to live\n",
      "to live in your own old, sweet way\n",
      "and so in time, death, which is of mans common lot and with Gods sanction, shall make you like to him\n",
      "This must not be\n",
      "We have sworn together that it must not\n",
      "Thus are we ministers of Gods own wish that the world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters, whose very existence would defame Him\n",
      "He have allowed us to redeem one soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem more\n",
      "Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise\n",
      "and like them, if we fall, we fall in good cause\n",
      "He paused and I said\n",
      "But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely\n",
      "Since he has been driven from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted\n",
      "he said, your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall adopt him\n",
      "Your maneater, as they of India call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl unceasing till he get him\n",
      "This that we hunt from our village is a tiger, too, a maneater, and he never cease to prowl\n",
      "Nay, in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar\n",
      "In his life, his living life, he go over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground\n",
      "he be beaten back, but did he stay\n",
      "He come again, and again, and again\n",
      "Look at his persistence and endurance\n",
      "With the childbrain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city\n",
      "What does he do\n",
      "He find out the place of all the world most of promise for him\n",
      "Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task\n",
      "He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers\n",
      "He study new tongues\n",
      "He learn new social life\n",
      "new environment of old ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was\n",
      "His glimpse that he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire\n",
      "Nay, it help him to grow as to his brain\n",
      "for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises\n",
      "He have done this alone\n",
      "from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land\n",
      "What more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him\n",
      "He that can smile at death, as we know him\n",
      "who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples\n",
      "Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil, what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours\n",
      "But we are pledged to set the world free\n",
      "Our toil must be in silence, and our efforts all in secret\n",
      "for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength\n",
      "It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love\n",
      "for the good of mankind, and for the honour and glory of God\n",
      "After a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing be definitely settled\n",
      "that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to think out the proper conclusions\n",
      "Tomorrow, at breakfast, we are to meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall decide on some definite cause of action\n",
      "I feel a wonderful peace and rest tonight\n",
      "It is as if some haunting presence were removed from me\n",
      "\n",
      "My surmise was not finished, could not be\n",
      "for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead\n",

      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for each and all of us\n",
      "When we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again\n",
      "It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature\n",
      "Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way\n",
      "even by death\n",
      "and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment\n",
      "More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream\n",
      "It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs\n",
      "Harkers forehead that I was brought back to reality\n",
      "Even now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent\n",
      "Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells\n",
      "it is only now and again, when something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar\n",
      "We are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action\n",
      "I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly\n",
      "and yet I fear that in some mysterious way poor Mrs\n",
      "Harkers tongue is tied\n",
      "I know that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be\n",
      "but she will not, or cannot, give them utterance\n",
      "I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone\n",
      "I suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work\n",
      "The Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called the Vampires baptism of blood\n",
      "Well, there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things\n",
      "in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything\n",
      "One thing I know that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs\n",
      "Harkers silences, then there is a terrible difficulty\n",
      "an unknown danger\n",
      "in the work before us\n",
      "The same power that compels her silence may compel her speech\n",
      "I dare not think further\n",
      "for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman\n",
      "Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others\n",
      "I shall try to open the subject with him\n",
      "When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things\n",
      "I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject\n",
      "After beating about the bush a little, he said suddenly\n",
      "Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate\n",
      "Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence\n",
      "then he stopped, so I waited\n",
      "he went on\n",
      "Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing\n",
      "A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed\n",
      "Van Helsing continued\n",
      "With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far\n",
      "Our task is now in reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance\n",
      "I can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face\n",
      "It is now but very, very slight\n",
      "but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge\n",
      "Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard\n",
      "But these are not all, there is to her the silence now often\n",
      "as so it was with Miss Lucy\n",
      "She did not speak, even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later\n",
      "Now my fear is this\n",
      "If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know\n",
      "I nodded acquiescence\n",
      "he went on\n",
      "Then, what we must do is to prevent this\n",
      "we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not\n",
      "This is a painful task\n",
      "Oh, so painful that it heartbreak me to think of\n",
      "but it must be\n",
      "When today we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by us\n",
      "He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured\n",
      "I knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion\n",
      "for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt\n",
      "I told him, and the effect was as I expected\n",
      "It is now close to the time of our general gathering\n",
      "Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it\n",
      "I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone\n",
      "At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing and myself\n",
      "Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us\n",
      "The Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved\n",
      "For my own part, I thought that if Mrs\n",
      "Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted\n",
      "Under the circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again\n",
      "We went at once into our Plan of Campaign\n",
      "Van Helsing roughly put the facts before us first\n",
      "The Czarina Catherine left the Thames yesterday morning\n",
      "It will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna\n",
      "but we can travel overland to the same place in three days\n",
      "Now, if we allow for two days less for the ships voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear\n",
      "and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks\n",
      "Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest\n",
      "Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations as may be necessary\n",
      "Of course we shall all go armed\n",
      "armed against evil things, spiritual as well as physical\n",
      "Here Quincey Morris added\n",
      "I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us\n",
      "I propose that we add Winchesters to our armament\n",
      "I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around\n",
      "Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk\n",
      "What wouldnt we have given then for a repeater apiece\n",
      "said Van Helsing, Winchesters it shall be\n",
      "Quinceys head is level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man\n",
      "In the meantime we can do nothing here\n",
      "and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon\n",
      "It is as long to wait here as there\n",
      "Tonight and tomorrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our journey\n",
      "said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us\n",
      "answered the Professor quickly, you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife\n",
      "Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice\n",
      "Let us talk of that part of it in the morning\n",
      "I want to consult with Mina\n",
      "I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her\n",
      "but he took no notice\n",
      "I looked at him significantly and coughed\n",
      "For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away\n",
      "Jonathan Harkers Journal\n",
      "For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think\n",
      "The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought\n",
      "Minas determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking\n",
      "and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess\n",
      "I am as far as ever from a solution now\n",
      "The way the others received it, too, puzzled me\n",
      "the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us\n",
      "Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child\n",
      "Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness\n",
      "Thank God, there are such moments still for her\n",
      "How strange it all is\n",
      "I sat watching Minas happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be\n",
      "As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me\n",
      "All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said\n",
      "Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour\n",

      "Quick, you must make it to me at once\n",
      "Mina, I said, a promise like that, I cannot make at once\n",
      "I may have no right to make it\n",
      "But, dear one, she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, it is I who wish it\n",

      "So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety\n",

      "You know that your safety is our solemnest duty\n",

      "and all will be well\n",
      "I shall not wait for any opportunity, said Morris\n",
      "When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment\n",

      "At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows\n",
      "when, however, the freedom ceases the changeback or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence\n",
      "Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle\n",
      "I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so\n",

      "When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moments delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head\n",

      "Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them\n",
      "It is mens duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial\n",

      "Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucys case to him who loved\n",
      "she stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase\n",
      "to him who had best right to give her peace\n",
      "If that time shall come again, I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me\n",

      "for we took special care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence\n",
      "In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it\n",
      "but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks\n",
      "The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied\n",
      "We talk of her often\n",
      "we have not, however, said a word to the others\n",
      "It would break poor Harkers heart\n",
      "certainly his nerve\n",
      "if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject\n",
      "Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her\n",
      "If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps\n",
      "\n",
      "We both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other\n",
      "We should neither of us shrink from the task\n",
      "awful though it be to contemplate\n",
      "Euthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word\n",
      "I am grateful to whoever invented it\n",
      "It is only about 24 hours sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London\n",
      "She should therefore arrive some time in the morning\n",
      "but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early\n",
      "We shall get up at one oclock, so as to be ready\n",
      "No news yet of the ships arrival\n",
      "Harkers hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment\n",
      "We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker, who is calm\n",
      "his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him\n",
      "It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that Kukri ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, icecold hand\n",
      "Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs\n",
      "Harker today\n",
      "About noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like\n",
      "although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it\n",
      "She had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping\n",
      "When, however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves\n",
      "She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else\n",
      "Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good\n",
      "Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days\n",
      "At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report\n",
      "Wherever he may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination\n",
      "To his doom, I trust\n",
      "Another day and no tidings of the Czarina Catherine\n",
      "She ought to be here by now\n",
      "That she is still journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs\n",
      "Harkers hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same\n",
      "It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog\n",
      "some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port\n",
      "We must continue our watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment\n",
      "Most strange\n",
      "no news yet of the ship we wait for\n",
      "Harker reported last night and this morning as usual lapping waves and rushing water, though she added that the waves were very faint\n",
      "The telegrams from London have been the same no further report\n",
      "Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he fears the Count is escaping us\n",
      "He added significantly\n",
      "I did not like that lethargy of Madam Minas\n",
      "Souls and memories can do strange things during trance\n",
      "I was about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand\n",
      "We must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state\n",
      "Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,      care H\n",
      "M\n",
      "Vice Consul, Varna\n",
      "Czarina Catherine reported entering Galatz at one oclock      today\n",
      "Sewards Diary\n",
      "When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected\n",
      "True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come\n",
      "but I think we all expected that something strange would happen\n",
      "The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected\n",
      "we only waited to learn where the change would occur\n",
      "None the less, however, was it a surprise\n",
      "I suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be\n",
      "Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a willothewisp to man\n",
      "It was an odd experience and we all took it differently\n",
      "Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty\n",
      "but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set\n",
      "Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily\n",
      "I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another\n",
      "Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well\n",
      "in our old wandering days it meant action\n",
      "Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer\n",
      "Harker smiled\n",
      "actually smiled\n",
      "the dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope\n",
      "but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there\n",
      "When does the next train start for Galatz\n",
      "said Van Helsing to us generally\n",
      "At 630 tomorrow morning\n",
      "We all started, for the answer came from Mrs\n",
      "How on earth do you know\n",
      "You forget\n",
      "or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing\n",
      "that I am the train fiend\n",
      "At home in Exeter I always used to make up the timetables, so as to be helpful to my husband\n",
      "I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the timetables now\n",
      "I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very carefully\n",
      "Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train tomorrow leaves as I say\n",
      "Wonderful woman\n",
      "murmured the Professor\n",
      "Cant we get a special\n",
      "asked Lord Godalming\n",
      "Van Helsing shook his head I fear not\n",
      "This land is very different from yours or mine\n",
      "even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train\n",
      "Moreover, we have something to prepare\n",
      "We must think\n",
      "Now let us organize\n",
      "You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning\n",
      "Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here\n",
      "Morris Quincey, you see the ViceConsul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube\n",
      "John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult\n",
      "For so if time be long you may be delayed\n",
      "and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report\n",
      "And I, said Mrs\n",
      "Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, shall try to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do\n",
      "Something is shifting from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late\n",
      "The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words\n",
      "but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and troubled glance\n",
      "We said nothing at the time, however\n",
      "When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs\n",
      "Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of Harkers journal at the Castle\n",
      "She went away to get it\n",
      "when the door was shut upon her he said to me\n",
      "We mean the same\n",
      "There is some change\n",
      "It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us\n",
      "Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript\n",
      "said I, unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone\n",
      "You are in part right, friend John, but only in part\n",
      "I want to tell you something\n",
      "And oh, my friend, I am taking a great\n",
      "a terrible\n",
      "but I believe it is right\n",
      "In the moment when Madam Mina said those words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me\n",
      "In the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her mind\n",
      "or more like he took her to see him in his earthbox in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun\n",
      "He learn then that we are here\n",
      "for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffinbox\n",
      "Now he make his most effort to escape us\n",
      "At present he want her not\n",
      "He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call\n",
      "but he cut her off\n",
      "take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him\n",
      "there I have hope that our manbrains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his childbrain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small\n",
      "Here comes Madam Mina\n",
      "not a word to her of her trance\n",
      "She know it not\n",
      "and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage\n",
      "when most we want all her great brain which is trained like mans brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away altogether\n",
      "though he think not so\n",
      "let me speak, and you shall learn\n",
      "Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits\n",
      "I fear, as I never feared before\n",
      "We can only trust the good God\n",
      "here she comes\n",
      "I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs\n",
      "Harker tripped into the room, bright and happylooking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery\n",
      "As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing\n",
      "He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read\n",
      "Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said\n",
      "Friend John, to you with so much of experience already\n",
      "and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young\n",
      "here is a lesson do not fear ever to think\n",
      "A halfthought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings\n",
      "Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that halfthought come from and I find that he be no halfthought at all\n",
      "that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings\n",
      "Nay, like the Ugly Duck of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duckthought at all, but a big swanthought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them\n",
      "See I read here what Jonathan have written\n",
      "That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land\n",
      "who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph\n",
      "What does this tell us\n",
      "no\n",
      "The Counts childthought see nothing\n",
      "therefore he speak so free\n",
      "Your manthought see nothing\n",
      "my manthought see nothing, till just now\n",
      "But there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it mean\n",
      "what it might mean\n",
      "Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in natures course they move on their way and they touch\n",
      "and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some\n",
      "but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues\n",
      "Is it not so\n",
      "Well, I shall explain\n",
      "To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime\n",
      "Yes and No\n",
      "You, John, yes\n",
      "for it is a study of insanity\n",
      "You, no, Madam Mina\n",
      "for crime touch you not\n",
      "not but once\n",
      "Still, your mind works true, and argues not a particulari ad universale\n",
      "There is this peculiarity in criminals\n",
      "It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that it is\n",
      "That is to be empiric\n",
      "The criminal always work at one crime\n",
      "that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other\n",
      "This criminal has not full manbrain\n",
      "He is clever and cunning and resourceful\n",
      "but he be not of manstature as to brain\n",
      "He be of childbrain in much\n",
      "Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also\n",
      "he, too, have childbrain, and it is of the child to do what he have done\n",
      "The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically\n",
      "and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start from to do more\n",
      "Dos pou sto, said Archimedes\n",
      "Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world\n",
      "To do once, is the fulcrum whereby childbrain become manbrain\n",
      "and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have done before\n",
      "Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues, for Mrs\n",
      "Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled\n",
      "He went on\n",
      "Now you shall speak\n",
      "Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes\n",
      "He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke\n",
      "His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and unconsciously, as she spoke\n",
      "The Count is a criminal and of criminal type\n",
      "Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and quâ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind\n",
      "Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit\n",
      "His past is a clue, and the one page of it that we know\n",
      "and that from his own lips\n",
      "tells that once before, when in what Mr\n",
      "Morris would call a tight place, he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort\n",
      "He came again better equipped for his work\n",
      "So he came to London to invade a new land\n",
      "He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home\n",
      "just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube from Turkey Land\n",
      "Good, good\n",
      "oh, you so clever lady\n",
      "said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand\n",
      "A moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sickroom consultation\n",
      "Seventytwo only\n",
      "and in all this excitement\n",
      "I have hope\n",
      "Turning to her again, he said with keen expectation\n",
      "Go on\n",
      "there is more to tell if you will\n",
      "Be not afraid\n",
      "John and I know\n",
      "I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right\n",
      "Speak, without fear\n",
      "I will try to\n",
      "but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical\n",
      "fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think\n",
      "Then, as he is criminal he is selfish\n",
      "and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one purpose\n",
      "That purpose is remorseless\n",
      "As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all\n",
      "So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night\n",
      "Oh, I felt it\n",
      "Thank God, for His great mercy\n",
      "My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour\n",
      "and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends\n",
      "The Professor stood up\n",
      "He has so used your mind\n",
      "and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us\n",
      "But his childmind only saw so far\n",
      "and it may be that, as ever is in Gods Providence, the very thing that the evildoer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm\n",
      "The hunter is taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says\n",
      "For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him, then his selfish childbrain will whisper him to sleep\n",
      "He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you\n",
      "there is where he fail\n",
      "That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the sun rise and set\n",
      "At such times you go by my volition and not by his\n",
      "and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands\n",
      "This is now all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where\n",
      "We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours\n",
      "We shall follow him\n",
      "and we shall not flinch\n",
      "even if we peril ourselves that we become like him\n",
      "Friend John, this has been a great hour\n",
      "and it have done much to advance us on our way\n",
      "You must be scribe and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them\n",
      "then they shall know as we do\n",
      "And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs\n",
      "Harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS\n",
      "CHAPTER XXVI  DR\n",
      "SEWARDS DIARY   This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz\n",
      "Last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset\n",
      "Each of us had done his work as well as he could\n",
      "so far as thought, and endeavour, and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz\n",
      "When the usual time came round Mrs\n",
      "Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort\n",
      "and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance\n",
      "Usually she speaks on a hint\n",
      "but this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything\n",
      "at last her answer came\n",
      "I can see nothing\n",
      "we are still\n",
      "there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser\n",
      "I can hear mens voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks\n",
      "A gun is fired somewhere\n",
      "the echo of it seems far away\n",
      "There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged along\n",
      "What is this\n",
      "There is a gleam of light\n",
      "I can feel the air blowing upon me\n",
      "Here she stopped\n",
      "She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a weight\n",
      "Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding\n",
      "Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harkers hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri\n",
      "There was a long pause\n",
      "We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing\n",
      "but we felt that it was useless to say anything\n",
      "Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly\n",
      "Would none of you like a cup of tea\n",
      "You must all be so tired\n",
      "We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced\n",
      "She bustled off to get tea\n",
      "when she had gone Van Helsing said\n",
      "You see, my friends\n",
      "He is close to land he has left his earthchest\n",
      "But he has yet to get on shore\n",
      "In the night he may lie hidden somewhere\n",
      "but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot achieve the land\n",
      "In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby\n",
      "But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he be carried he cannot escape\n",
      "And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain\n",
      "Thus, in fine, if he escape not on shore tonight, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him\n",
      "We may then arrive in time\n",
      "for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy\n",
      "for he dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered\n",
      "There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn\n",
      "at which time we might learn more from Mrs\n",
      "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance\n",
      "The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before\n",
      "and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair\n",
      "Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort\n",
      "at last, in obedience to his will she made reply\n",
      "All is dark\n",
      "I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood\n",

      "He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London\n",
      "Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service\n",
      "When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river\n",
      "When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent\n",
      "I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth\n",
      "I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood\n",
      "The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat\n",
      "propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream\n",

      "Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further\n",
      "Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass\n",

      "As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept\n",
      "Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down\n",
      "But all was indeed changed\n",
      "the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a steeprising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell of in his diary\n",
      "At once I exulted and feared\n",
      "for now, for good or ill, the end was near\n",
      "I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her\n",

      "Then, ere the great dark came upon us\n",
      "for even after downsun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight\n",

      "and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was well guarded\n",
      "She sat still all the time\n",
      "so still as one dead\n",
      "and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale\n",

      "Though there might be danger to her body, yet her soul was safe\n",
      "Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them\n",
      "When they did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time\n",
      "Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest\n",
      "and every time my coming was with quiet of them\n",
      "In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist\n",
      "Even in the dark there was a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow\n",
      "and it seemed as though the snowflurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments\n",

      "I began to fear\n",

      "It was as though my memories of all Jonathans horrid experience were befooling me\n",
      "for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him\n",
      "And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain\n",
      "Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away\n",
      "I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round\n",
      "I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me\n",
      "when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was\n",
      "No\n",
      "Do not go without\n",
      "Here you are safe\n",
      "I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said\n",

      "whereat she laughed\n",
      "a laugh, low and unreal, and said\n",
      "Fear for me\n",
      "Why fear for me\n",
      "None safer in all the world from them than I am, and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead\n",
      "Then, alas\n",
      "Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without the Holy circle\n",
      "Then they began to materialise till\n",
      "if God have not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes\n",
      "there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat\n",
      "I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips\n",
      "They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina\n",
      "and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the waterglasses\n",
      "Come, sister\n",
      "Come to us\n",
      "Come\n",
      "In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame\n",
      "the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all of hope\n",
      "God be thanked she was not, yet, of them\n",
      "I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire\n",
      "They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh\n",
      "I fed the fire, and feared them not\n",
      "for I knew that we were safe within our protections\n",
      "They could not approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter\n",

      "It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell\n",
      "We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers\n",
      "Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued\n",
      "they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops\n",
      "Closer and closer they drew\n",
      "The Professor and I crouched down behind our rock, and held our weapons ready\n",
      "I could see that he was determined that they should not pass\n",
      "One and all were quite unaware of our presence\n",
      "All at once two voices shouted out to Halt\n",
      "One was my Jonathans, raised in a high key of passion\n",
      "the other Mr\n",
      "Morris strong resolute tone of quiet command\n",
      "The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken\n",
      "Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr\n",
      "Seward and Mr\n",
      "Morris on the other\n",
      "The leader of the gypsies, a splendidlooking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed\n",
      "They lashed the horses which sprang forward\n",
      "but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop\n",
      "At the same moment Dr\n",
      "Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them\n",
      "Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up\n",
      "The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack\n",
      "Issue was joined in an instant\n",
      "The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the sun\n",
      "now close down on the hill tops\n",
      "and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand\n",
      "For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart\n",
      "I should have felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them\n",
      "I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something\n",
      "Seeing the quick movement of our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command\n",
      "his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order\n",
      "In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart\n",
      "it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set\n",
      "Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them\n",
      "Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention\n",
      "Jonathans impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him\n",
      "instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass\n",
      "In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground\n",
      "In the meantime, Mr\n",
      "Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany\n",
      "All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him\n",
      "He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I thought that he too had come through in safety\n",
      "but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting through his fingers\n",
      "He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his bowie\n",
      "Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield\n",
      "the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the top of the box was thrown back\n",
      "By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr\n",
      "Seward, had given in and made no resistance\n",
      "The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow\n",
      "I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him\n",
      "He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well\n",
      "As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph\n",
      "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathans great knife\n",
      "I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat\n",
      "whilst at the same moment Mr\n",
      "Morriss bowie knife plunged into the heart\n",
      "It was like a miracle\n",
      "but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from our sight\n",
      "I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there\n",
      "The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun\n",
      "The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as if for their lives\n",
      "Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiterwagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them\n",
      "The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone\n",
      "Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side\n",
      "the blood still gushed through his fingers\n",
      "I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back\n",
      "so did the two doctors\n",
      "Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder\n",
      "With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained\n",
      "He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said\n",
      "I am only too happy to have been of any service\n",
      "he cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, It was worth for this to die\n",
      "look\n",
      "The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light\n",
      "With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest Amen broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger\n",
      "The dying man spoke\n",
      "Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain\n",
      "the snow is not more stainless than her forehead\n",
      "The curse has passed away\n",
      "And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman\n",
      "NOTE   Seven years ago we all went through the flames\n",
      "and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured\n",
      "It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boys birthday is the same day as that on which Quincey Morris died\n",
      "His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friends spirit has passed into him\n",
      "His bundle of names links all our little band of men together\n",
      "but we call him Quincey\n",
      "In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and terrible memories\n",
      "It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths\n",
      "Every trace of all that had been was blotted out\n",
      "The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation\n",
      "When we got home we were talking of the old time\n",
      "which we could all look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily married\n",
      "I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago\n",
      "We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one authentic document\n",
      "nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later notebooks of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsings memorandum\n",
      "We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as proofs of so wild a story\n",
      "Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee\n",
      "We want no proofs\n",
      "we ask none to believe us\n",
      "This boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is\n",
      "Already he knows her sweetness and loving care\n",
      "later on he will understand how some men so loved her, that they did dare much for her sake\n"
