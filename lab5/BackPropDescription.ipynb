    "# Lab 5 Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this lab you'll implement a basic backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Design\n",
    "A model design for a Layer and Network class comes with the lab.  This is the skeleton of the working reference application.  You may adjust it modestly if you like, but any serious deviation must first be OKed by me.  This is a difficult algorithm to design well, and this starting point will help.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Overview\n",
    "Write a single Python application BackProp.py, that accepts three commandline arguments: a command \"run\" or \"verify\", and two files, the first a network configuration file and the second a file of input/output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration file format\n",
    "Two example configuration files are given.  Each contains a JSON object with these properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *arch* an array of pairs describing the layers of a network, including its dimension and activation.  The input layer has no activation function.  Other layers may have \"relu\" or \"softmax\".  \n",
    "* *err* either \"cross_entropy\" or \"mse\", describing the error function.\n",
    "* *weights* (optional) an array of 2-d weight arrays, one for each layer other than the input layer.  Note that each has a different dimension, appropriate to its layer.  This means you can't convert the whole thing into one big numpy array, though each element may be so converted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If *weights* is present, use these initial values for the network weights.  Otherwise assign small values between -.5 and .5 to all weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file CfgEx contains a configuration matching our in-class example, including initial weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data file format\n",
    "Two example data files are given.  Each contains a JSON object describing an array of input/output pairs.  Each input and output is an array of values of dimension appropriate for the corresponding Cfg file.  The DataEx file contains a single input/output pair matching the in-class example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Commands\n",
    "The two commands *run* and *verify* operate thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify\n",
    "The verify command is the first you should implement.  For each input/output pair (possibly just one) it does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Runs a forward propagation to establish an output value and corresponding error value.  \n",
    " 2. Reports the actual output vs the expected output, and the resultant error.\n",
    " 3. Runs a single backpropagation to determine dE/dW values.\n",
    " 3. Systematically, for each weight at each level, adjusts that weight by .01, reruns the forward propagation to get a new error value, and reports the difference and the ratio of the difference to the expected difference (.01 * dE/dW for the adjusted weight) as a percentage, to 4 decimals. \n",
    " 4. Returns the weight to its original value. \n",
    "\n",
